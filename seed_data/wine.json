Each of our wines comes from different vineyards around Washington state and each vintage faces its own unique winemaking practices and challenges.  Because of the vintage and lot variation, a wine which is vegan in 2011 for example, may not be with the 2012 vintage.\r\n\r\n\"Given the sensitivity of dietary requirements, 14 Hands prefers to error on the side of caution and not title any of our wines vegan.\"\r\n\r\nCompany email (March 2014):\r\n\"14 Hands Riesling and 14 Hands Hot to Trot Red Blend are both vegan. No animal products are used in their production. All of our grapes are sourced from Washington, many from our own estate vineyards, and the wine is made and bottled at our winery facility in Paterson, WA.\"\r\n\r\nCompany email (January 2012):\r\n\"In regards to your question, 14 Hands wines are not vegan.  While we do not make a practice of using animal products in our wines, we may, on occasion,\r\nresort to the use of egg whites (on a very small scale) to reduce excessive or harsh tannins.  We do our best to manage tannin pick up in the wines during fermentation but, every once in a while, a wine is\r\ntoo big, too tannic or too drying to fit the 14 Hands profile.  So, we will, from time to time, rely on the very effective, natural and traditional method of softening the wines by egg white fining.\r\n\r\nWe also do not manufacture our wines anywhere else in the world besides Washington state.\"",

Its always my goal as a winemaker to never use fining/clarification/\r\nfiltration/cold stabilization etc. on our wines, and\r\nonly in situations where its absolutely necessary would I even consider it.

And because I am vegan, one of the things I mention in the articles is whether the wines are vegan-friendly. \r\n\r\nI recently wrote about Barrel Oak Winery, and as part of my interview with Brian Roeder, the owner, I asked if they use animal products for fining. Brian told me that they only use bentonite, if anything. Many of their wines are not fined or filtered at all.\"\r\n\r\nLink to the article: http://fairfaxnews.com/2013/07/take-a-bow-bow/\r\n",

"notes": "Company Email:\r\n\"It's interesting that you send this note, and I very much appreciate your effort.  It was just a few weeks ago that I got accosted at the farmers market by a few folks who couldn't believe that we would even consider making a wine that wasn't vegan.  It was very disheartening since we are trying very hard to move as many of our products towards sustainable and organic farming practices as possible.  We've even got to the point where all but one of the wines we completely make ourselves are from organic grapes.  So, your note was quite refreshing.  I am in the process of going back and looking through all our winemaking notes.  I'm not sure how familiar you are with our wines, but we have four labels:  Stumbling Block, Shy Chenin, Reversal, and Basket Case.  The Basket Case brand is a combination of wine that we produce ourselves as well as wine we have contract made for us by other wineries.  Though we are pretty involved in that wine making as well, I'm not comfortable telling you that they are Vegan-chances are they are not.  <b> As for the other three labels-Shy Chenin, Stumbling Block, and Reversal, we make all those wines and I am 90% sure they are Vegan.  I am only hesitating until I get all of the records for all of the lots in front of me at one time.  As a general rule, we try very hard not to add animal products, not because we are necessarily against it (although there is so much interest we are planning on making our wines 'Vegan' just because we can) but because our style of winemaking is to be as minimal as possible.  To my knowledge we have not done any fining with animal products, but let me get back to you on that. Just out of curiosity, what do you as a vegan think of PVPP?  It's basically a plastic that is used sort of like a fining agent.  I would think it would be considered Vegan, but I'm not that big a fan of sticking micro-petroleum particles into my wine.  Funny, huh?  Technically it would be Vegan, but certainly not organic!\"",

In using these agents the winemaker is further fine-tuning the structure of the wine. The use of small amounts of fining agents is generally necessary to ensure that the wine will be clear, stable, have longevity, and be enjoyable to taste. \r\n\r\nThe winemakers decide which fining agents are used and these may vary from product to product and even batch to batch (usually depending on the grapes of that particular year). It is important to note that despite fining agents being used during the winemaking process, they are removed prior to bottling.  In addition, all of our wines are gluten free and the products we use to make our wines, such as yeast, fining agents, filters and barrels are also gluten free.\"\r\n\r\nCompany email: \r\nThank you for contacting us about our Beringer wines. After checking with our winemaking team, I have learned that on a very limited number of our red wines we might add casein (from milk) and albumen (egg whites). Both of these are proteins and are used as fining agents to remove tannins and reduce astringency. These are removed as precipitates and it is doubtful any traces of these proteins remain after the fining operation. It depends from year to year which red wines may be put through this process, so I can't tell you specifically which wines might be affected. On the other hand, our white and blush wines, such as Chardonnay and White Zinfandel are not fined at all. They may go through a filtering agent such as cellulose pads or diatomaceous earth. In membrane filtration the wine is passed through a thin film of plastic polymer material having uniformly sized holes. In both cases nothing is added to the wine.\r\n\r\nAh, sounds semi-good, but then we get company email 2:\r\n\r\nThank you for contacting Beringer.  We do not recommend any of our wine for vegans due to the possibility that the wine has been clarified with fining agents such as egg albumin, casein, gelatin and isinglass. The winemakers decide on which fining agents are used and these may vary from product to product and even batch to batch (usually depending on the grapes of that particular year). It is important to note that despite fining agents being used during the winemaking process, they are removed prior to bottling.

However, our white wines are free of any animal products and are vegetarian and vegan friendly.  Ages ago, it was discovered that egg whites added to wine would aid in removing unwanted tannins. This 'tannin fining' process is used to improve the flavor of red wines by limiting the astringency caused by the tannins. The egg whites settle to the bottom and are then filtered out. All residue of the egg whites is removed from the wine.\"",

Some of these techniques involve animal byproducts including, for example, egg whites, which may be used and then removed in certain steps of the winemaking process.  This may seem odd to those unfamiliar with the centuries-old art of winemaking, however these practices are widely used to this day and often result in levels well below human detection - the scale of which is measured by single parts per million gallons or liters.\r\n\r\nWhile most would consider this level insignificant, we take the concerns of our vegan friends very seriously and in good conscience, do not claim our wines to be 100% vegan.  Although there are other wineries that may not make the same decision, we feel that honesty and integrity are the best winemaking techniques and hope our supporters enjoy the results!\"",

With international safety standards, consumer health considerations and also wine presentation, however, wine needs to be stabilized from a microbiological standpoint. Lees and excess tannins need to be removed from wine to make it fit for sale, which involves a process called fining, or clarification.\r\n\r\nIn order to minimize loss of colour and flavour, and also ensure no off-flavours are added to the wine, at Concha y Toro we use the most wine-friendly fining agents possible.  Depending of the state of the must, in the case of white wines, and the young wine, in the case of reds, we use the minimum amount of animal derived proteins or minerals possible for fining. Prior to bottling, all flocculated protein residues are filtered off. In other words, while animal proteins may be employed, the final wine is effectively protein free. Therefore, at the end of the day it is a matter it is matter of consumer choice. Concha y Toro will use viable non-animal derived fining agents where possible. \"",

None of our wines (especially the Rieslings) have any animal products in them.  The whites are fined with Bentonite (a volcanic clay like material) and filtered through Diatomaceous Earth.\r\n\r\nIn the past, we have used gelatin to fine our reds but we haven't done that for years and never to a Gamay or a Pinot.  I did try egg white fining experiments in the lab but they failed miserably, so I won't be doing that.\r\n\r\nI guess the short answer to your question would be-  No, we do not use animal products in our wines.

"notes": "Company email (August 2013):\r\n\"One of the common questions we receive about our wines is whether they contain products which can cause an allergic reaction. Products such as eggs, fish protein and gelatins are commonly used in a process called “fining”.  Fining is a clarification technique. The proteins in the fining agent bind with tiny particles in the wine and settle to the bottom of the storage container.  The wine is then pumped or siphoned off, leaving the sediment behind.  The wine making process I use results in wines that do not require fining. In the rare occasion where one is needed, I use allergen free fining agents. They are more expensive, but worth it.\"\r\n",

"notes": "Company email (June 2015):\r\n\"The statement on Barnivore is correct. We have some wines that are vegan friendly but we have not sought any formal designation. Many of the 2012 reds mentioned below are sold out. I thought it be wise to not mislead you and provide you with a wine that may not be thoroughly vetted and fall short of your standards. I do know some vegans who enjoy our wines regularly while other choose not to. We respect everyone's right to choose.\"\r\n\r\nCompany email (April 2015):\r\n\"We do get this question several times a year. Our usual fining agent is bentonite, an clay-based substance. Occasionally we will use albumin (egg) and rarely casein to assist in the fining process. This could occur on a tank-by-tank basis in vintages when our red wines have more tannins than we would like.\r\n\r\nI can confirm that all of our white wines are vegan friendly. In 2012 the tannins in our red wines were soft so we didn't need to move beyond bentonite. Our 2012 reds are on the shelf now or are about to hit the shelf and I can honestly say they are among the best we have ever produced.\"\r\n\r\nCompany email, February 2012:\r\nSorry for the delay in getting back to you. The production team tells me that the current vintages that are available for sale may have had albumin used at one point in the fining process in a tank or two. So the original statement on your website is correct and should be the one that is available to your members.\r\n\r\nCompany email, February 2012:\r\n\"Please revert to our 'older' comment about the rare use of albumin. It is correct.\" [Note: we've asked for more information]\r\n\r\nFrom the company (July 2011):\r\n\"I came across your notation of our winery as NOT vegan friendly. We have not used albumin as a fining agent for many years. If we fine at all we use bentonite. Therefore we are vegan friendly.\"\r\n\r\nCompany email (older):\r\n\"At Chateau des Charmes our fining agent of choice is bentonite, an inert clay. On rare occasions we will need to supplement the bentonite with albumin (egg white). But this is the winemaking team's decision and is on a tank-by-tank basis.\"",

It is important to note that despite fining agents being used during the winemaking process, they are removed prior to bottling.

Lots of people I speak with does not know about the difference between a Vegan Certification (issued by ICEA VEGAN in Italy, which certifies that our wines have no animal derivatives nor suffering) and The Vegan Society \"Registration\" (that is a registration, not a certification). Our wine has both Certification (ICEA) and Registration in UK with The Vegan Society.\"\r\n\r\nFrom the website\r\n(http://www.veganitaly.com/about/biodynamic_vegan.html, January 2012):\r\n\r\nCristina guarantees that:\r\n1. All her products are obtained excluding any animal suffering, of any kind;\r\n2. No animal derivates enter into her productive chain in any form;\r\n3. Soil fertilization is done exclusively with manure (manure is a natural donation);\r\n4. Biodynamic Preparations don’t derive from cow horns or deer bladders, but from boxes of larch and birch’s barks (Fladen);\r\n5. All her animals live free and they are not used for milk, meat or for other purposes, but just for the manure that they naturally produce and for the grass they eat, and that they are neither killed nor exploited;\r\n6. In her company pesticides are not used.\"\r\n\r\n",

"notes": "Company email (May 2014) re: La Merika Wines:\r\n\"The short answer is “no” we do not make the statement that our wines are vegan or vegetarian friendly.  Since there may be slight differences/variations from vintage to vintage our winemakers need to have access to tools to help make the wines as consistent as possible.  Some of these tools can make the wine non-vegetarian or non-vegan.  In order to maintain as much flexibility as possible, we do not make claims that our wines are Vegan or Vegetarian friendly.\"\r\n\r\nCompany email (November 2013):\r\n\"Unfortunately we cannot make the statement that any of the wines we produce is vegan or vegetarian-friendly.  Each vintage is different and our winemakers need to use the tools necessary to make our wines as consistent as possible.  We do import some wines as well, which would be another reason we could not guarantee a vegan or vegetarian status.\"\r\n\r\nCompany email (November 2011): re: Gnarley Head Wines\r\n\"We haven’t made the move to vegan status at this point, but we respect what you’re doing to help consumers who prefer to follow a vegan diet and we don’t want to mislead anyone or confuse them.\"\r\n\r\nCompany email (2011): re: Bubo Wines \r\n\"We prefer to have our wines listed as not vegan friendly. Normally we don’t use animal-derived products in our wines, but depending on the characteristics of a particular blend, we may choose to use a fining agent or some other processing aid including egg whites, gelatin or isinglass.\"\r\n\r\nCompany email (January 2010): re: Delicato Wines \r\n\"We also produce Delicato wines. The information about the Delicato wines on Barnivore is correct at this time, but please change the listing to read not vegan friendly. We may decide to add additional varietals to the Delicato line as well, so we would like to have these wines listed as non vegan-friendly as well. -Quality Control Manager DFV Wines\"\r\n\r\nCompany email (January 2010): \r\n\"Bota Box wines are not always vegan-friendly. Quality Control Manager DFV Wines\" \r\n\r\nCompany email (January 2010): re: Bota Box Wines\r\n\"Generally speaking, we don't use animal-derived products in the wines, but unfortunately, I can't make the statement that there will never be an animal-derived product used. As our winemakers make decisions about everything from harvesting the grapes to which corks to use in bottling, there are occasionally times when they feel that a wine needs some additional fining to remove excess color, solids, etc. At that point, they might use something like egg whites or gelatin to improve the quality of the blend. As a consumer, there is really no way for you to tell which blends we might have used these products in. Quality Control Manager DFV Wines\"\r\n\r\nCompany email (January 2010): re: Gnarley Head Wines\r\n\"We also produce Gnarly Head wines which are listed on Barnivore.com as 'vegan-friendly, except for Chardonnay'. That statement was true at the time it was given to a consumer. Since that time, we have produced a Pinot Grigio under the Gnarly Head label and we are about to roll out a Viognier. Neither of these wines will always be vegan-friendly. Therefore the statement 'vegan-friendly except for Chardonnay', is no longer appropriate. Just to be safe, we prefer that all Gnarly Head wines be listed on Barnivore.com as non vegan-friendly to ensure that consumers are not misled. - Quality Control Manager DFV Wines\"\r\n\r\nCompany email (2010): \r\nFollowing is a short list of red wines that do not use animal by-products in the fining process: \r\nGnarly Head Old Vine Zinfandel \r\nDelicato Merlot \r\nDelicato Cabernet Sauvignon \r\nDelicato Shiraz\r\n\r\nCompany email (July 2009): re: Bota Box Wines\r\n\"Yes, our wines use no animal products or by-products in their production. -Brand Manager\"",

In using these agents the winemaker is further fine-tuning the structure of the wine. The use of small amounts of fining agents is generally necessary to ensure that the wine will be clear, stable and sound, have longevity and be enjoyable to taste.\r\n\r\nThe winemakers decide on which fining agents are used and these may vary from product to product and even batch to batch (usually depending on the grapes of that particular year). It is important to note that despite fining agents being used during the wine making process, they are removed prior to bottling.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n",

"notes": "Company email (September 2015):\r\n\"We do not use soy-based products in our winemaking process; however, we sometimes use potassium caseinate as a fining agent in just a few of our white wine lots. Casein is derived from milk. Most of the casein is removed in the winemaking process, but trace amounts may be present in the final wine. Our Winemaker Charlie Gilmore, has a very hands-off approach to winemaking and strive to let the natural fruit shine through. Fining, however, reduces sediment and cloudiness and ensures that the wine that ends up in your glass is stabilized and clear. \"\r\n\r\nCompany email (March 2015):\r\n\"We don't market our wines as being vegan, because we use some animal by-products as fining agents in some of our red and blush wines. After using these products, the wines are filtered and no residue of these agents remains in the wine. These fining practices are standard in the wine industry globally. The bottom line: red and blush wines use animal by-products, whites don't.\"\r\n\r\nCompany email (December 2012):\r\n\"In response, while we do offer our various product lists, some products in our stores and the selections offered may actually vary somewhat by state and region. The primary reason for this is that we also attempt to source products locally whenever we can, as we also do not ship our products over really long distances.  Our lists are also not all-inclusive, and are offered moreso as a guideline of possible product selections.  \r\n\r\nIn response, to your inquiry regarding our possible vegan wine options, we are enclosing a list of possible vegan wine selections below:\r\n\r\nBonterra-Whites are vegan\t\r\nCastle Rock-All are vegan\t\r\nCharles Shaw-Reds are vegan *occasionally gelatin is used in the whites' refining processes, but that it is removed from the end product\r\nCline Cellars-All are vegan\t\r\nFetzer-Whites are vegan\t\r\nGeorges Dubeouf-All are vegan\t\r\nKendall Jackson-Whites are vegan\t\r\nRosenblum Cellars-All are vegan\"\r\n\r\nCompany email: July 2010 & Oct 2010\r\n\"We use a \"tannin fining\" process for our red wines in which egg whites are added to aid in removing unwanted tannins. This process was discovered ages ago to be an effective way to improve the flavor of red wines by limiting the astringency caused by the tannins. The egg whites settle to the bottom and are then filtered out. No residue of the egg whites remains in the wine.\r\n\r\nFor our white wines, we use a \"protein fining\"' or \"clarification\" process using Bentonite, a naturally occurring form of clay, to remove the \"haze\" of proteins present in the wine. Again, filtering leaves no residue remaining in the wine.\r\n\r\nBoth of these fining practices are standard in the wine industry globally. The bottom line: red wines use animal by-products, white wines don't.\"\r\n\r\nCompany email:\r\n\"We use organic egg whites in the fining process of our red wines. However, our white wines are free of any animal products and are vegan friendly. \" ",

"notes": "Company email (September 2014):\r\n\r\n\"We inform you that in the first production steps of our process, we use a low dose of gelatine in order to clarify the must before fermentation. This gelatine is of pork origin. We are presently investigating the use of vegetal gelatines in order to be able to certify that our products are also suitable for vegans, but we cannot certify it yet.\"\r\n\r\nUPDATE: January 2010\r\n\"Gelatine has traditionally been associated with quality wines. Indeed, gelatine appears to be one of the clarifiers with greater agglutinating capabilities, and more selective power in the fining of wine. \r\nIn addition to that, gelatine is used in very low doses (average dose is 1 gr. per 100 liters of  must). We are talking about one gram of a transformed, purified, and sanitarily harmless product. On top of that, gelatine is eliminated from the wine by filtration, after agglutinating with the existing colloidal materials in the wine. \r\nAnother advantage of gelatine is that it offers high productivity during the filtration due to its agglutinating power. Otherwise, a couple of things could happen:\r\n•\twine filtration cycles would be considerably shorter, increasing at the same time the filtration costs.\r\n•\tit considerably would increase the volume of filtering earth needed with the inevitable environmental damages that this represents. \r\nFor the production of our Cava, we use both our own base wines and wines selected from other wineries. Some of these wineries have implemented modern methods to separate the lees (Mosto fining) based on modern flotation systems. One of the advantages of these systems is the elimination of filtering earths and, therefore, reducing the environmental impact. One of the key elements in this system is the use of the gelatine. \r\n<B>It is for these reasons that we sincerely believe that using small amounts of gelatine in the transformation process of wine, should not have any effect on consumption by vegetarians.\r\nIn conclusion, if we were not allowed to use gelatine, we would have to carry out a rigorous study on the consequences over our products and facilities. This would involve an important work of advising and control over our suppliers, which some of whom have adapted their systems to the separation of lees process described previously.</B>\r\n\r\nUPDATE\r\nCompany Email:\r\n\"Our wines are not suitable for vegans since we use a clarifying agent that has egg whites. \"\r\n\r\nCompany Email:\r\n\"Our wines are not suitable for vegans since we use a clarifying agent that has egg whites.\"\r\n\r\n",

All  Hardys wines are processed and blended in Australia.\" \r\n\r\nCompany email:\r\n\"I have spoken to the Senior Brand Manager , she has reiterated that fining agents such as isinglass, skim milk powder, gelatine and egg white are used in the wine making process to clarify our wines. The fining agents used can vary between each product and from vintage to vintage and their purpose is to soften and stabilise the wine. The wine is then filtered to remove the finings but there many be slight traces left, which is why the fining agent will be listed in the wine's ingredients. \r\nBecause of this process, we cannot guarantee that our wines are suitable for Vegan / Vegetarians as finings maybe left in slight traces\"",

"notes": "Company email (October 2011):\r\n\r\nFrom Andy Marshall, Assistant Marketing Director... \"Thanks for contacting us!  I’m actually a vegan and one of the things I was most excited about when I started working here in 2006 was how many of the wines were made without the use of animal products and how receptive the winemaking staff was to trying to cut down even more on how many were.  We maintain a special section of our website that only lists our vegan wines: http://www.huntwines.com/Vegan-Wines.  On that page you will also find a link to a chart that details which wines are made with and without animal products.  If the wine does contain any animal products, it is listed specifically on that chart.  Only one wine is made outside our facility, our Chardonnay Champagne, and we are unsure if any animal products are used in its production and consequently do not list it as a vegan-friendly wine.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nI'm writing to let you know that the wines at Hunt Country Vineyards, located in Upstate NY, are vegan (with only a couple exceptions, I'm still working on those ones).  I've been working at Hunt Country since 2006 and have been asking them ever since to make their wines vegan and we finally got there with the last two vintages - 2006 & 2007!.  Please visit the following link for more information <a href = \"http://www.huntwines.com/hcv_vegan_wine.html\">http://www.huntwines.com/hcv_vegan_wine.html</a> and feel free to contact me with any questions.

Below is an edit of three emails I received from Jennifer Cowan, Visitor Experience Administrator, Great Estates of Niagara, Constellation Brands. She provides some insight on their BC wines as well.]\r\n\r\n\"Thank you for contacting us with your concerns.  Our winemaker Marco Piccoli informed me that we do not use these agents [casein, gelatin and egg albumin] in our VQA wines.  Although they have been used during testing in the past, Marco, our lab technician and I just had a conversation about this and they indicated that they are not used at this time.\r\n\r\nI am familiar with this website [Barnivore].  ... Given that there is no source noted [on the latest update], I can only assume that it was not anyone from the Niagara Estate that provided that information; it may have been someone from Niagara Falls Cellars who produce the non-VQA product. Again, Marco has just reiterated the he DOES NOT use these ingredients during the winemaking process. Marco intends to follow up with the appropriate individuals within Constellation Brands.\r\n\r\nI also spoke with Bruce Nicholson, Inniskillin winemaker, yesterday.  Bruce is the former Jackson-Triggs Okanagan winemaker, and he indicated that he has not used these ingredients during production process for many years.  Derek Kontkanen, one of the Jackson Triggs Okanagan winemakers presently, did his tutelage under Bruce and I would presume also adheres to the practices that he learned from Bruce.\r\n\r\nTo my knowledge, Jackson-Triggs Niagara has never made an overt claim or been advertised as 'vegan friendly' wine , however, these agents are not used here.\"\r\n\r\nCompany email (January 2013):\r\n[I checked with them yesterday (and this would be for both the Niagara Estates and the Unity wines, in fact all their vineyards) and it appears they cannot guarantee that ANY of their wines are vegan.]\r\n \r\nHere was their response:\r\n\"Fining agents are used on a lot-by-lot basis to optimize the quality.

In some Cabernet Sauvignon vintages, our winemaking team will add egg whites during the fining process—an old-world tradition that helps soften the tannins, ensuring a more approachable mouthfeel. After our Chardonnay is pressed, we use a bento casein, which is a water soluble dairy-based product, to fine the juice and help preserve the wine against oxidation.\r\n \r\n\"Most recent vintages of Jordan Cabernet Sauvignon that are vegan:\r\n2003\r\n2008\r\n2009\r\n2010\"\r\n\r\nCompany email (November 2012):\r\n\"Many vintages of Jordan Cabernet Sauvignon are egg white fined.  However, the 2003, 2008, 2009 and 2010 vintages do not have any animal ingredients. Unfortunately all of our Chardonnay is fined at the juice stage with casein, a milk bi-product.  \r\nOur product is only manufactured at our winery in Healdsburg, CA.\"\r\n\r\nCompany email:\r\n\"Thank-you for emailing your question regarding the use of fining agents on our wine.  I don't know if you are referring to our Chardonnay or our Cabernet so I will attempt to answer both.\r\n\r\nChardonnay:  we use a combination of bentonite (earth based ) which is a montmorillonite clay that is used to drop out any protein that may cause a haze in our white wine.  For the juice, prior to fermentation, a combination of both bentonite and casein (a milk derived protein) is used which softens the astringent nature of our wine by minimizing the effect of the skins from the grape pressing.  The sediment (lees) from the deposition of the fining agent and the proteins, phenolics from the juice are racked (drawn) off and sent out for disposal (actually another winery uses the settlings). Of course our Chardonnay is filtered prior to bottling.\r\n\r\nCabernet:  the only fining agents we use are protein/animal based: gelatin and egg white.  The gelatin is used in very small quantities and helps remove amorphous material as well as microbial (yeasts and malolactic bacteria) that cloud the wine.  Fresh egg whites (not the yolk) is added as a way of balancing out the oak tannins and the fruit derived tannins.  It is a very common procedure used throughout the world; but some winemakers elect not to use egg whites as they fear it will remove flavor components.  We use egg whites because we feel the flavor components are enhanced.  I don't know if it is possible for residual egg whites to be present in our wine.  We filter our wine prior to bottling and after fining (0.65 microns absolute- which means nothing passes through the filter larger than 0.65 microns.  This is to eliminate any residual yeast and most malolactic bacteria) so I would imagine that the bound egg white with the tannin complex is removed.\"",

All residue of the egg whites is removed from the wine. \"\r\n\r\n\r\nCompany Email for Little Black Dress.\r\n\"In years past, we did use a fining process on white wines that included gelatin.   Although we don't currently use that practice, I could not guarantee that we would never use it again.  Also, in place of egg whites, we have used gelatin in some of our red wines, but again, this is a rare.\"",

"notes": "Company email (February 2013):\r\n\"Aha, that’s a great question regarding fining. You are absolutely correct in worrying about fining, as they have used gelatin, egg whites, even ox blood (no longer allowed) to either aid in settling or to remove unwanted tannins. I have never fined my red wines since my first vintage in 1996, and I do not fine my top Chardonnays. I’m philosophically opposed to fining as it seems to me that if the wine is too astringent, then the grapes were picked on the wrong day, the equipment and handling were not gentle enough, or inappropriate barrels were used. Its trying to correct a mistake, while I would like to avoid a mistake.  So, pick when skin tannins are lower, I use no pumps for moving grapes, its either shoveled by hand or I use a bin turner on the forklift and I only use French oak and not too much of it. I rack wines carefully with nitrogen gas and age for a long time for wines to settle clear naturally, and then give a light filtration prior to bottling, and so don’t need other clarification.\r\n \r\nWhen I press the white grapes I use only the first 130 gallons or so of high quality juice for my Chardonnay program. There is a lot more juice still left in the grapes, so after this I continue to press, but divert this juice to my “Sonoma White” program. As this juice is higher in tannins derived from the skins, I do use a small amount of fining to help this. I generally use milk, adding about 200 mls of Clover Whole milk per barrel (I like the clover products, found in whole foods etc and they use no hormones and it’s the only milk I use at home). I have sometimes used a very light dose of ininglass as well. The Sonoma White, and occasionally my Rose, have been the only wines fined in the history of the winery. \r\n \r\nIts interesting that the Australians are now putting this info on the labels, as traces may remain in the wine. I believe the FDA is about to make this mandatory here in the US as well.  I think it’s a good thing. My red wines will generally say” Ingredients: grapes and sulfites only”. Some times I add yeast in years when the grape quality and microbe levels are compromised by rain. Otherwise its just grapes and sulfites. I do add yeast to white wines.\"\r\n",

Exceptions to this are a few of our premium wines that undergo minimal or no filtration prior to bottling and therefore may not be completely free of animal products.\"\r\n",

( I would have to double check this, but cannot do it right now as I am on vacation )\r\n \r\nSo I believe all our white wines fall in the vegan category at the moment.\r\n \r\nAs an aside, I think it is important that our customers are aware of the distinction between additions made to the wine, and fining agents which act on the wine, but importantly do not stay in the the wine.\r\n \r\nAn example of an addition, would be Tartaric acid, which is an additive to the wine and stays in the wine.\r\n \r\nFining agents include skim milk, egg whites and gelatin, which act on the wine but do not stay in solution. I appreciate that to vegans, this still means animal product has come into contact with the wine and therefore they cannot consume it, but I have met many people who think that these products are added to the wine and become part of it's structure, which is incorrect.\r\n \r\nI think it is always wise to check with individual wineries first, before making a purchasing decision, unless it is marked on the bottle that the wine is suitable for vegetarians and /or vegans.\"",

"notes": "Company email (April 2013):\r\n\"Oyster Bay wines, depending on the variety and vintage, are often fined with a range of products.\r\nIn the case of the white varieties (Sauvignon Blanc and Chardonnay) a proportion of the juice receives gelatine fining prior to fermentation.  Once the wine has been blended it will generally receive a light fining with whichever fining agent produces the superior result.  This can be either a non-animal derived fining agent or a traditional fining agent derived from milk such as casein or skim milk or gelatine or fish (isinglass).\r\nThe red varieties (Pinot Noir and Merlot) receive a similar fining regime except that the fining agents used at blending may include egg whites which may also be used as a traditional fining agent.\r\nFining agents are considered processing aids as opposed to additives because it’s not expected that any of the added material will remain in the wine by the time it reaches the bottle. This is because fining agents bind to tannins in the wine and precipitate to form solids which are filtered from the finished wine.\r\nWith regard to the manufacture of our wines, they are all made and bottled at our winery in Auckland, New Zealand and then distributed globally.\"\r\n",

Es decisión del Departamento de Enología el tipo de clarificante a utilizar en función de las características organolépticas de cada vino. Algunos clarificantes, como las gelatinas, son de origen animal.  Cabe resaltar que el agente clarificante, a pesar de que ha estado en contacto con el vino, no se encuentra en el producto final y si lo hace, es en muy baja concentración.  Como conclusión no podemos decir que todos nuestros vinos sean aptos para vegetarianos y veganos ya que dependerá del origen del clarificante que se haya utilizado.  Aprovecho la ocasión para agradecerle que confié en nuestras marcas\"\r\n\r\n[Google translation: \"As you know, for clarification of various wine clarifiers they are used.\r\nIt is up to the Department of Enology clearer type used according to the organoleptic characteristics of each wine.

On various white wines and Rose’, We have on rare occasions had to use fining agents to remove undesirable characters from the wine. It is rarely done here and I seriously doubt if any of the fining material is left in the wine as it’s purpose of fining is to attract the elements we want to remove and have them settle to the bottom of the tank, and the wine racked off the top.  Also, All of our whites end up being cold stabilized and sterile filtered before bottling which would greatly reduce any chance of any residual fining agent existing in the wine.\r\nWe attempt to avoid fining and manipulation of any wine in an attempt to allow the true character of the vintage and varietal to shine.  Of the 10 wines we are currently serving, not a one has been fined but we do have two wines in the cellar that have been fined because of the mildew pressures of the late harvest in 2010. This is the first time since the 2003 vintage that we have had to fine any juice.\"\r\n",

Well, we had to add some sugar in 2007.\r\n\r\nBackground on animals and wine: basically, animal products are added because the winemaker is trying to use protein to make other chemicals such as tannins fall out of solution.  This is almost exclusive to red wines.  When we fine white wines, we are trying to remove protein, so we are adding things such as bentonite clay.\r\n\r\nThe hotter the climate the grapes are grown, the more pressure there is to use fining agents on red wine.  Hot climates increase the skin to weight ratio at harvest, meaning the grapes have more tannin in them.\r\n\r\nWe don't fine our red wines: meaning no ox blood, isinglass, milk protein, egg whites, etc.  We have found that patience and time in the barrel address the needs.  We sometimes add Stabavin to our white wines, which is Gum Arabic.  I don't think that is prohibitive to vegan diets, but thought I'd disclose it since you're more qualified to judge.\"\r\n\r\nIn conversation with winemaker:\r\n\"All wines vegan\"\r\n\r\n",

What this means at Querciabella is that respect for the environment and animal life is central to the way we work during all phases of wine growing and production.\r\n\r\nWhile Querciabella has long been a benchmark of sustainability, converting to organic viticulture in 1988 and subsequently transitioning to biodynamics in 2000, the winery's owner Sebastiano Cossia Castiglioni, an outspoken animal rights activist, decided to ban all animal-derived products from the estate in 2007. As a result of our rigorous 100% Vegan policy, we have eliminated the use of animal products not only from the cellar but from the vineyards as well, relying exclusively on the use of cover crops for soil management\"",

Exceptions to this are a few of our premium wines that undergo minimal or no filtration prior to bottling and therefore may not be completely free of animal products.\r\n \r\nAlso, treatment of wines with milk or egg products is a common wine industry practice and is done by winemakers as needed to provide the appropriate treatment and clarity to the wine. These milk or egg products are removed during the filtering of the wines after treatment.

"notes": "Company email (February 2014):\r\n\"I checked with our head of winemaking and replied with the following details.\r\nOf anything we use in winemaking, the only item that could potentially be used that is non-vegan, is egg whites.  When used, it is only used as a fining agent to reduce tannins.  When added to a wine, it will be listed as an ingredient on the back label.  Generally the only wine that receives egg whites at Ridge is the Cabernet Estate, occasionally the Merlot, too.  We do not use isinglass, gelatin, casein, or any other animal derived products.  Also, our wines are bottled at our own facilities (MB or LS wineries) under our full control.\"\r\n\r\nCompany email (May 2014):\r\n\"Thank you for your inquiry about Ridge Wines and more specifically Lytton Springs.   Ridge now lists ingredients on all of our labels, so it is easy for you to see everything that is used and in our wines.  Pertaining to the Lytton Springs, we may on occasion add tartaric acid and egg whites for tannin fining.   We don’t add gelatin, isinglass, or lysozyme.  The only animal product even remotely considered is fresh egg whites.  If added, it would be listed as an ingredient. Our preference, however, is to avoid adding anything, except sulfur dioxide (which we can’t avoid using as oxidation and random spoilage would create significant issues with wine quality.)\r\n \r\nAdditionally, our wines are not manufactured or bottled anywhere else in the world.\"\r\n\r\nCompany email:\r\n\"To try and answer your question, as a general matter of winemaking practice, we do not use any animal products, however, this is not 100% the case. There are infrequent times when, for the purpose of tannin reduction in reds, egg whites are used to fine the wines, and isinglass is very occasionally used to remove yellow pigments in chardonnay. So while these are by far and away the exceptions to the rule, it would not be accurate to classify us as strictly vegan. I should think vegan-friendly might be more appropriate. Ridge is in fact at the forefront of a push to see wine labels follow food industry practices of including all ingredients on wine labels. Should this movement succeed, this would ideally make your task a much easier one!\"",

"notes": "Company email (November 2011):\r\n\"None of our wines are technically vegan friendly, as we use some natural fining agents like egg white in our reds and isinglass (from fish) in our whites. All of these are filtered out in the end, but some vegans prefer that nothing animal be used whatsoever, so I thought I should be totally up front with you on this matter.\"\r\n\r\nCompany email (November 2011):\r\n\"Yes, all of our wines are fined with either egg whites or isinglass, and sometimes gelatin. We process all of our wines here at the winery in Healdsburg, CA.\"\r\n\r\nCompany Email:\r\n\"The use of fining agents in winemaking to make wine taste/smell/look better is an ages old practice. Fining can eliminate bitterness, astringency, brown color, cloudiness, and other things best left out of wine. After the fining agent is added to wine, it clings physically or electrostatically to whatever protein or other targeted substance in the wine, and gravity generally brings it to the bottom of the storage vessel. The wine can then be drawn off the sediment, and may or may not be subjected to filtration. Some fining agents are \"earth\" based, and some are \"animal\" based. While theoretically no fining agent will end up in the final wine, strict adherents to some versions of vegetarianism would prefer not to make use of any product if animal derived substances were used during processing.\r\nFining is never done formulaically. Rather, if a wine might be subject to some improvement in, let's say astringency, then a representative sample of the wine is trialed under laboratory conditions with a variety of fining agents in varying amounts that are known to reduce astringency. The four best fining agents to reduce astringency are all animal based: egg whites, gelatin, isinglass (from fish), and casein (from milk). Other commonly used fining agents include bentonite (a clay), Sparkolloid (from algae), and activated carbon. Keep in mind that fining is an optional tool, and if a wine is delicious as it is, it may not require fining at all.\r\nSo what's a vegan to do?\r\nGenerally, red wines are more likely (but not necessarily) to have been fined for astringency with an animal based product than white wines. Some red wines are bottled as \"unfined\" and these are really the only prudent choice for a strict vegan. White wines, too, are sometimes fined with casein or isinglass, so it is always recommended that vegans contact a winery directly to learn what wines are best suited to them.\r\nOf the current releases of Rodney Strong Vineyards wines, vegans should be comfortable enjoying our 2007 Charlotte's Home Sauvignon Blanc, and our 2007 Sonoma County Chardonnay, both of which were finished only with \"earth\" based fining.\"",

"notes": "Company email (July 2012):\r\n\"Please find attached a list of our vegan wines.  I have also noted which ones are certified organic.\"\r\n\r\nCompany email:\r\n\"-Red wine we make our premiums with the free run fraction, which doesn't have the harsh tannin of the press fraction.  Our premium free run reds are bottled unfined, unfiltered, making all of our top reds Vegan Friendly. However the press red, in our case (Tumbleweed Red) is fined with egg white to strip tannins.That is our only fined red.  Other fining agents strip the colour from red.\r\n\r\n-  White wines I usually just use bentonite, but again our premiums are generally free run, or very lightly pressed to avoid astringency, and the bentonite is sufficient to achieve protein stability when properly used.  The press white has more astringency from seeds, skins, and stems, and may require gelatin which is a very strong fining agent.  Improperly used it can easily strip a wine bare, and is rarely used in my cellar.  The single wine of ours that I have used gelatin on is the, as of yet unreleased, Tumbleweed White NV (accumlated years of press fractions).  On our 2006 Luminescence Chardonnay, we used some Isinglass in fining as a bit of an experiment, but I found that I much prefer to use bentonite for the compact lees and faster settling.  \r\n\r\nOur 2007 Luminescence is the only Certified Organic Chardonnay in BC at the moment, definitely Vegan Friendly!  The 2008 will also be...\r\nThat would make all of the other Chardonnay vintages Vegan Friendly, as well as our Riewurztrafeleron*, previously Riewurztrafelser Blanc.  *Riesling, Gewurztraminer, Ehrenfelser, Auxerrois, Chardonnay, Semillon!  100% of the whites from Stoney Slopes Vineyard in OK Falls in one tank!  Vines over 20 years old.  This one was released in May and sold out in July since its inception.  That is the problem with single vineyard bottlings, you can't expand production! ;)\r\n\r\n-Icewine - Bentonite fining only. All Vegan Friendly.\"",

"notes": "Company Email:\r\n\"Your inquiry into fining agents was forwarded to me.  You are correct in saying that many wineries use fining products in their wines but I think that it is much less than in the past.  I remember when I first started winemaking in the early 90’s I used several of these products.  But now because of educational advances in grape growing and winemaking many of these products are unnecessary.  For example, in red wines these products were used to mellow out harsh tannins after the fermentation.  Because the vineyard canopies have been opened up to allow more sunlight onto the fruit these tannins are not as hard.  Also in the winery there is more attention to pump-over management and temperature of fermentation which reduces the extraction of these harsh tannins.  So, to answer your question here at St Francis we do not use any animal based products in our wines.\"\r\n\r\n...And later we got some clarification (no pun intended):\r\n\r\n\"Vegan friendly\"? Meaning do we like vegans? Of course!\r\n\r\nIf you are asking if our wines are vegan, I would say yes to all except the zinfandels, which SOMETIMES receive dosing of an egg-white product. The purpose is it eliminates certain killer yeast that can hinder fermentations. We've only used it on zins since they come in so ripe. That substance is immediately dropped to the bottom, and by the time the wine is bottled it has been through a couple rackings + sterile filtering so there would be no remnants whatsoever of the egg whites. But, to be truthful I would say no to the zins.\"",

In using these agents the winemaker is further fine-tuning the structure of the wine. The use of small amounts of fining agents is generally necessary to ensure that the wine will be clear, stable, have longevity, and be enjoyable to taste. \r\n\r\nThe winemakers decide which fining agents are used and these may vary from product to product and even batch to batch (usually depending on the grapes of that particular year). It is important to note that despite fining agents being used during the winemaking process, they are removed prior to bottling.

Generally, none of these products remain in the wine because they are removed by filtration prior to bottling. A few of our premium wines that undergo minimal or no filtration prior to bottling are exceptions and therefore may not be completely free of animal products. We hope that with this information you can make an informed decision that meets your dietary needs.\r\nOur wine is only bottled in Modesto, California and we are not at liberty to give out contact information.

The answer, unfortunately, is not too clear. Our wine makers use various fining agents during the wine making process. Some of these products are suitable for vegans, however sometimes in order to get the wine just right, they add products such as gelatin, which I know is not something that is appropriate for vegans. The hard part is that it depends on how the wine making is going and how the particular \"recipe batch\" is going. The wine makers then decide which fining agents should be added to achieve the desired end result.\r\n\r\nI'm sorry we don't have a more specific answer but unfortunately, it does vary from vintage to vintage.

Your question brings up a very interesting issue.\r\n\r\nFor centuries, winemakers have used traditional, natural techniques to fine and filter their wines.  Some of these techniques involve animal byproducts including, for example, egg whites, which may be used and then removed in certain steps of the winemaking process.  This may seem odd to those unfamiliar with the centuries-old art of winemaking, however these practices are widely used to this day and often result in levels well below human detection - the scale of which is measured by single parts per million gallons or liters.\r\n\r\nWhile most would consider this level insignificant, we take the concerns of our vegan friends very seriously and in good conscience, do not claim our wines to be 100% vegan.  Although there are other wineries that may not make the same decision, we feel that honesty and integrity are the best winemaking techniques and hope our supporters enjoy the results!\"",

The Vegan Vine is brand new to the market and we would love to have it included in your wine list. We would also like to send you samples so you can review it.\r\n\r\nWe are currently in select Whole Foods in California, Texas and Georgia and have distributors in Washington and. Oregon The Vegan Vine offers California Central Coast wines including Sauvignon Blanc ($9.99), Cabernet Sauvignon ($12.99) and Rhone ($11.99) varietals.\r\n\r\nThe Vegan Vine does not use any animal products in wine production. We allow the wines to naturally settle out the undesirable particles and the winery has the benefit of a climate and terroir that creates a softer, naturally occurring wine. The excess compounds are removed with sterile filtration, that promotes the freshness of the wine, without animal products.\r\n\r\nClos LaChance has been making wine since 1992. We have a tradition of great wines and The Vegan Vine is no exception.\"",

With international safety standards, consumer health considerations and also wine presentation, however, wine needs to be stabilized from a microbiological standpoint. Lees and excess tannins need to be removed from wine to make it fit for sale, which involves a process called fining, or clarification. \r\nIn order to minimize loss of colour and flavour, and also ensure no off-flavours are added to the wine, at Viña Maipo we use the most wine-friendly fining agents possible. Depending of the state of the must, in the case of white wines, and the young wine, in the case of reds, we use the minimum amount of animal derived proteins or minerals possible for fining. Prior to bottling, all flocculated protein residues are filtered off. In other words, while animal proteins may be employed, the final wine is effectively protein free. Therefore, at the end of the day it is a matter it is matter of consumer choice.\" \r\n\r\n",

Here's what I learned...\r\n\r\n1) At the winery, we plan strategies during the entire winemaking process that mitigates severe issues that could necessitate aggressive treatments using animal-based, gelatin-type additives.\r\n\r\n2) We generally don't use fining agents for our winemaking, but there are times when we need to. When we do, the agents we use may be derived from egg whites or milk-based casein.\r\n\r\nSo unfortunately the short answer is no, for strict vegans our wines can't be guaranteed 100%.\"",

I understand that this has become a concern for much of the vegan and the vegetarian groups out there in the country, because of this a lot of research has been done to test and see what actually makes it through the filtration and thus ending up in the bottle.  The fact is almost zero of what we use makes it through the process.  Both egg whites, lysozymes and others help us clarify the wines helping them last longer in the cellar.  I understand that a lot of people want nothing to do with harming a living creature and I respect that, but we do use these process at our winery, and to be honest I do not know a single winery in the county that doesn't.   \r\n\r\nAs for the bottling line, no we we are very lucky to have our own.  We do everything in house and at the top of our industry.  However,  most small wineries will bring importable bottling lines to their properties to bottle as it saves them a huge chunk of money.

"notes": "Company Email:\r\n\"Winexpert does not include any animal products in the juices and concentrates we use in our wine kits. The only reference I can find in regards to animal products in wine production is the very old rustic Italian practise of including a pound of horseflesh in a barrel of wine, to 'make it stronger'. That sounds really disgusting, and horses are for petting, not eating.\r\n\r\nOur fining agents are derived from animals. Isinglass is a colloidal protein made from the swim bladders of Cichlid fish, dried, processed and dissolved\r\nin a liquid. As a side-note, the bladders are a by-product of a food fishery in Africa and the entire enterprise is completely sustainable.\r\n\r\nThe Chitosan is a long-chain sucrose polymer made from the shells of crustaceans like prawns, crabs, lobsters and shrimp. Again, it is a by-product of a food fishery.\r\n\r\nHowever, it is simple to replace these products with Agar gelatine, derived from seaweed and easily available from health food stores. Dosage rates are\r\nproblematic, but I would start with two teaspoons of gelatine powder dissolved in a cup of water to start.\r\n\r\nThese product facts aside, it's important to note that many non-animal derived foods and beverages have significant sources of animal-derived products in them, as a consequence of where they are grown and harvested. To quote California winemaker and researcher Lum Eisenman,\r\n\r\n\"On average, one ton of California wine grapes contains seven pounds of dirt, one mouse nest, 147 bees, 98 wasps, 1,014 earwigs, 1,833 ants, 10,899\r\nleafhoppers and three pounds of bird droppings. In addition, the waxy coating on grape skins contains many microorganisms. Grapes are crushed without washing, so crushed grapes contain several non-grape substances and many microorganisms. Consequently, attempting to sterilize crush equipment seems a bit futile. The nitrogen (bird droppings) and protein materials (bugs) are consumed during fermentation by the yeast. When fermentation is complete, the dirt, bees wings, earwig tails, etc. settle to the bottom of\r\nthe fermenters, and much of the yeast and ugly stuff is left behind when wine is racked.\"",

In using these agents the winemaker is further fine-tuning the structure of the wine. The use of small amounts of fining agents is generally necessary to ensure that the wine will be clear, stable and sound, have longevity and be enjoyable to taste.\r\n\r\nThe winemakers decide on which fining agents are used and these may vary from product to product and even batch to batch (usually depending on the grapes of that particular year). It is important to note that despite fining agents being used during the winemaking process, they are removed prior to bottling.\"",
