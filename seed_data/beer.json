However, it would depend on how far back in the food chain you want to go.  For example Monks Ale is made using only water, yeast, three varieties of hops, three types of malts and CO2 (for carbonation).  We filter the beer using a chalk based filter. No other additives or other materials are used in making the beer.  None of the hops or malts are certified as organic so I cannot attest to the actual growing process.  For example, I have no idea what (chemical or animal based) fertilizers may have been used to grow these ingredients  All the ingredients have USDA certifications that they are fit for use in making products that are safe for human consumption.  The Monks' Wit uses the same ingredients but uses only two hops and one malted barley. It also has red wheat, white wheat, flaked oats, bitter orange peel, sweet orange peel, coriander, and another spice. For this beer, all the ingredients and sources are approved by the FDA.  We do a coarse filter using a chalk based filter.\r\nYes, our beer is also produced under contract by Sierra Blanca Brewing Company in Moriarty, New Mexico.  They use the exact same ingredients and processes because we source all the ingredients for both breweries.\" \r\n\r\n",

Unfortunately it will be hard to find as only 12 casks of it in existence! We don't bottle either. If it goes well, we will brew it again but will be seasonal as is a specialty cloudy wheat beer.\"\r\n\r\nCompany Email:\r\n\"I'm afraid we do use isinglass.\"",

Well, centrifuges actually like the yeast very homogenized throughout the vessel.\r\n\r\nSo, please feel free to drink all of our beers without worry...outside of The Beast...it has honey in it.\"\r\n\r\nCompany Email: June 2010\r\n\"We have one beer - The Beast - that has\r\nhoney in it. We also occasionally use isinglass as a fining agent to\r\nlower our yeast (another eukaryote that we beat up on!) cell counts.\r\nUnfortunately I would be unable to tell you which, if any, beers were\r\nmade using isinglass because it is very sporadic. We are changing our\r\nprocess and anticipate eliminating the occasional use of isinglass\r\nsometime in early 2011.\" \r\n\r\nUPDATE:\r\n\"Your info [animal finings used for all beers] is correct. I do wish there were another product to use but there isn't so we are dissappointing some vegans out there. Glad to hear you're doing what you're doing. Will help alot of people. Follow up: We have explored the centrifuge idea and will probably invest in one in the next two years. It's not feasible at our current production rate but as that rate increases it becomes more realistic. Love to get those vegans on our side!\"\r\n\r\nCompany Email: \r\nWe have changed yeast strains which has decreased the frequency we use isinglass as a fining agent prior to filtration, but we still do use it on occasion. I would not be able to tell you which beers and when because it is a case by case situation.\r\n\r\n@kmudrick notes that \"I've heard comflicting reports from Avery, as recently as a couple of weeks ago, that sometimes they fine, sometimes they don't\" - time for a double check...\r\n\r\nJulie writes:\r\n\"I noticed on your list that Avery's beer is listed as not vegan friendly.  But I have spoken with one of the brewers who has always been super helpful in picking out vegan-friendly beers of theirs (the unfiltered stuff has always been vegan)--they switched yeast strains a few months back and no longer use isinglass.  so now their beer is vegan-friendly.\"\r\n\r\n",

(Filtering is usually done at breweries with DE or synthetic media in a plate filter; fining is the process of clarifying beer by adding an ingredient - like egg whites, gelatin, or isinglass - that causes proteins and other haze to settle out in a conditioning vessel.)\"\r\n\r\nDouble check:\r\n\r\nThe beer is brewed after the strict Bavarian Purity Law, the oldest law for alimentary products. This means the beer contains only malted barley, water, hops and yeast. Water is tertiary water from our own deep well, the barley is from fields of our area around Aying, hops comes from Holledau/Hallertau - also in Bavaria and yeast is produced from our own pure cell yeast cultures for bottom fermentation.",

Any special ingredients, like the coffee we use in Java Stout for example, will be mentioned on the label as well.\r\n \r\nAll of our beers, whether they are brewed at our production facility in Comstock, Michigan or at our original brewery in Kalamazoo, meet the criteria for vegetarian status. We do not use isinglass or other animal-derived process aids at any point in our brewing process. Unlike most breweries, our beers are entirely unfiltered, except for our three lager beers, and we do not use finings in any of our brands.\r\n \r\nWith three exceptions, everything we package for distribution to bars and stores qualifies not only as vegetarian but also as vegan. Those three exceptions are Hopslam, Eccentric Ale and Sweet Potato Stout – all of which contain honey. Our Mead is also made with honey, but it is only available at the Eccentric Café in Kalamazoo.\"\r\n\r\nPhone Contact (October 2011):\r\n\"to confirm their Two-Hearted Ale is vegan. It is.\"\r\n\r\nCompany email : April 2010\r\n\"All of our packaged products sold for retail are vegan with the exception of Hopslam as it is brewed with honey. The Eccentric Ale is more often than not, not vegan.By packaged beers I mean everything we sell out in the marketplace (bottles, kegs, mini cans and cask). We do some experimental beers at our pub, but those do not get out into stores.\"\r\n\r\nCompany email:\r\n\"All of the beer that we package for distribution to bars & stores qualifies as vegetarian. Occasionally, we will make specialty batches that may contain honey for our own pub or selected festivals. The most prominent is Eccentric Ale, a beer we make once a year in a very limited quantity. Customers can ask any of the bartenders at the Eccentric Cafe in Kalamazoo for information about the specialty taps. I should specifically mention that our Bell's Double Cream Stout does not contain any dairy-derived ingredients: the name refers to the creamy texture, not actual cream or lactose. You can find a list of our major brands at http://www.bellsbeer.com/brands.asp.\r\n\r\nUpdate 2006-12-15: Gary from Bell's wrote in with a warning about Hopslam Ale:\r\nI am writing to update you as to the status of a beer we launched as a new fall seasonal. Called Hopslam Ale, it broadly falls into the category of Imperial IPA (we're not big on style guidelines here). It does, however, contain honey as a source of fermentable sugar. Language to that effect was left off the initial run of labels, but I believe that will be corrected next season. I have already revised my standard reply to questions on whether our beers are vegan, and the presence of honey should be stated on our website as soon as we publish the next revision.\r\n\r\nCompany email 2 via Rick:\r\nAll Bell's products are vegan, with these exceptions:\r\n\r\n(1) Hopslam Ale (contains honey)\r\n(2) Eccentric Ale (contains honey)\r\n(3) No \"specialty brews\" served at their bar should be considered vegan without consulting with the bartender/brewmaster, as others may contain honey.",

As a Vegan friendly kettle clarifying agent, we use Whirlfloc G, which is a modern granular kettle fining agent derived from Euchema cottonii. Added 10-20 minutes prior to the end of boil it gives excellent wort  clarity, improved beer clarity post conditioning and enhanced colloidal stability of the finished beer. The Vegan friendly secondary clarifying agents we use is called BioFine CL, which is a purified colloidal solution of silicic acid, (SiO2), in water that has been specifically formulated for the rapid sedimentation of yeast and other haze forming particles in beer. Both of these are Vegan friendly.\"\r\n\r\nCompany email (July 2012):\r\n\"unfortunately they are not.

Our beers are filtered in two stages using dense fiber and paperboard filter pads to trap the yeast cells and to give our beers the desired clarity. As far as ingredients are concerned, we use 100% 2-row Canadian barley and we do not use any adjuncts, or any preservatives, or artificial additives. We do not use any corn or other barley substitutes at all. Our beer is brewed to the German purity standards of 1516 and, because we are a 100% natural product, we do not have an ingredient list.

In the UK, it seems that a fish based product is used to filter the beer.\r\n \r\nIn the rest of Europe, Kronenbourg is a brand of Carlsberg and brewed by Carlsberg in France (Obernai) and perhaps other breweries. In France, it seems that no animal based product is used.\r\n \r\nWhen Carlsberg and Heineken devided the spoils of the Scottisch and Newcastle take-over, Carlsberg got France and Heineken got the UK. For Kronenbourg a special agreement was made. The orginal Kronenbourg breweries are in France and belong to Carlsberg, but Heineken was allowed to keep the brand for a couple of years. Heinken was also in the dog house for the advert with Eric Cantona, because it's Kronenbourg is brewed in the UK instead of France. I was in Obernai recently and took a tour of the brewery where the guide explained this after a remark made by somebody from the UK.\r\n \r\nWhatever the Carlsberg and Heineken agreement is, it seems that Kronenbourg beer can be consumed in France - but not in the UK - by a true vegetarian.\"\r\n\r\nCompany email (June 2014):\r\n\"Kronenbourg [UK] is not suitable for vegetarians as it is clarified using isinglass finings which are fish derived.\"\r\n\r\nCompany email (May 2014):\r\n\"Vous nous avez contactés concernant une demande d’information sur la composition, le processus de fabrication et de filtration des bières Kronenbourg.\r\nNous vous informons donc que concernant nos produits Kronenbourg nous n'utilisons pas de produits d'origine animal dans la composittion, la fabrication et la filtration.\"\r\n[Google translation] \"You have contacted us regarding a request for information on the composition, manufacturing process and filtration Kronenbourg beers. \r\nWe inform you about our products Kronenbourg we do not use any animal product in composition, manufacturing and filtration.\"\r\n\r\nCompany email (October 2011)\r\n\"Although Heineken UK products are not tested on animals, we treat our some of our beers with isinglass finings (a solution of collagen prepared from certain fish). This is the only animal product which Heineken UK ever uses in beer production.\" [Heineken makes Kronenbourg, the mail was in response to a Kronenbourg question]\r\n\r\nUPDATE: June 2009\r\nFosters Company Email:\r\n\"All other Foster beer brands made in Australia are not vegan friendly, including Stella Artois, Carlsberg and Kronenbourg\" \r\n\r\nCompany Email:\r\n\"Although  Scottish  &  Newcastle  UK products are not tested on animals, we treat  our  beers  with  isinglass finings (a solution of collagen prepared from certain fish).\r\n\r\nThis  is the only animal product which Scottish & Newcastle UK ever uses in beer  production.  Isinglass  has  been  used  in  beers for centuries as a clarification agent during beer conditioning.  In keg and small pack beers, there  is  very  little,  if any finings left in the finished product as it settles  out  with  the  yeast,  and  any  residues  are removed during the filtration process.\r\n\r\nIn cask beers, however, finings is added to the beer when it is packaged to assist  the  settling  of  the  live yeast that is an integral part of cask conditioning.  Cask beers, then, will always have some finings in the cask, but  if the beer has been treated properly in the pub and isn't cloudy, the sediment  containing  the  majority of finings remains at the bottom of the cask and very little carries through to the finished product.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately,  fish  finings  work so well that all attempts by brewers to find  a suitable alternative have by and large been unsuccessful. There has been  no  concern over health aspects, as no consumer ill effects have ever been reported over the many, many years that finings have been used.\r\n\r\nAlthough  the  conclusion drawn is that there is little, if any, finings in the  finished product, it is advised that as the product may contain traces of finings that we do not say it is suitable for vegetarians.'\r\n\r\nWith  regards  to  our  ciders,  three  of  our products, Strongbow Sirrus, Bulmers Original and Jacques use an animal product as a colouring material. Our  other  ciders  do not use any animal products as ingredients.  However some  of  our  processes occasionally use isinglass finings as a clarifying agent  and  as  such we can't guarantee that any of our ciders are suitable for vegetarians.\"",

"notes": "Company email (December 2011):\r\n\"You have a legitimate concern, especially now in this era of blurring lines between food and beer where some brewers see fit to throw all kinds of crazy things into their recipes simply for the sake of a gimmick (in my opinion).\r\n \r\nAs a brewer, I'm more of a traditionalist: I like my beer to be beer & my food to be food. I love pairing the two together, but I wonder about the point of pushing the envelope too much with \"novel\" brewing ingredients. Other than the occasional recipe which uses honey, I can't think of any other animal product which we use in the production of our beer.\r\n \r\nWe try to keep our recipes and process streamlined to avoid any unnecessary complexity, such as processing aids. This gives us the best degree of control over the flavor of our beer.\r\n \r\nI've used isinglass finings at other breweries, but we don't utilize that here and have no intention of doing so, even with our cask beer.\"\r\n\r\nThank you so much for your response.  I really appreciate hearing that the majority of your beers are vegan friendly!  Do you know specifically which beers may use honey?  Or would it say in the name of the beer?\r\n\r\n\"Typically these beers are seasonal beers that are at the pub for a short period of time then gone. The most recent one we did was the 15th Anniversary beer back in July. It was a Saison that had honey in it. There isn't necessarily anything about the name which would indicate if honey or some other product like that is used, but it is possible. Take for instance the beer style \"Milk Stout\", which utilizes lactose sugar. If we were to brew a beer like this it would be obvious in the name, but that isn't always the case.\r\n \r\nNone of our year-round beers utilize any animal products as ingredients or in the brewing process.\"\r\n\r\n",

The guy they put me in contact with, who was responsible for the beer promised me that the Campus beer is absolutely vegan friendly.  There is no problem for vegans, no animals are used/harmed for the making of this beer.

I just noticed that someone has done a write up about our brewery on how none of our beer was vegan except the Kolsch that we supplied to the Acorn. I just want to give you an update that it was only the Kolsch that wasn’t vegan at that time. Now we are proud to use absolutely no animal products in any of our brews… and never will.\"\r\n\r\nCompany email (January 2015):\r\n\"We use isinglass finings on the majority of our beers.  As we don't have a beer filtration system, we have found that using isinglass is currently the only way to get our beers to the clarity that we (and our customers) find acceptable.\r\n\r\nWe do occasionally prepare a small vegan batch of our Wunderbar Kolsch, which we bottle in-house and distribute to The Acorn restaurant/bar on Main Street.  I believe all of the beer they sell there is vegan.\r\n\r\nAlso, occasionally some of our seasonal brews are prepared without finings -- the most recent example was this year's version of 'The Grinch'.  This really depends on the beer, however -- if it is a dark enough beer and a bit of haze is acceptable in the final product then we won't use isinglass.  More often than not we do use it though.\r\n\r\nFinally, all of our cask-conditioned beers are prepared without isinglass, in a vegan-friendly manner.  We tap one of these casks every Friday at our brewery.  We also sell these to a variety of restaurants/bars around town -- The Railway Club, Craft, and Biercraft frequently have these on offer.\r\n\r\nOur product is manufactured solely by us, at our North Vancouver facility.\"\r\n",

Although our website states that our cask conditioned beers use isinglass, this is no longer true. A vegan substitute, Biofine Clear, is currently used to filter our cask beers. Here's some more info in case it's helpful:\r\n\r\nNone of our beers contain traces of milk, or corn. However, there is some residual sugar: glucose, maltose, and maltotriose. These sugars are derived from malted barley. We do not add sulfites as a preservative to our beer. Any sulfur formation is a result of the fermentation. Therefore, all of our beers are low in sulfites. Brooklyn Lager would be a good example of low sulfites, which has less than 1 ppm (the average sulfite content for wine is 80 ppm). Typically, sulfur dioxide levels in our beer are less than 1 ppm. The exceptions are Winter Ale, Black Chocolate Stout, Black Ops and Monster Ale, which have levels of 5-7 ppm of sulfur dioxide.\"\r\n\r\nCompany email:\r\n\"Lucky for you, we do not use isinglass in our filtering process, so none of our kegged or bottled beers have any animal products in them. A word to the wise though, if you happen to stop at a restaurant or our Brewery when we have casked beer, those do use isinglass so be sure not to have that (a cask is naturally carbonated beer that is aged. it looks like a smaller rounder keg turned on it's side with tap on one end).\"\r\n\r\nCompany email:\r\n\"The only beers we produce that contain any animal products are our cask-conditioned ales (on the handpump or direct from the cask), which contain isinglass. We produce very little of this beer and you would be aware if it was being served to you. The other 99.99% of our beer contains no animal products and is suitable for vegans.\"\r\n\r\nAdditional email:\r\n\"All of our beers are vegan (that includes\r\nbottles and kegs) with the exception of our cask beers. We do not use\r\nany animal derivatives or sugars, and our filters are rice filters.\"",

However there is potentially a change to our bottles as on some occasions, if the yeast cell count is abnormally high, finings may be used to reduce it. As no finings is present in the finished product we are not automatically informed if this has happened by our bottlers.\"",

However, when we do filter we use a filter medium that has diatomaceous earth in it. It is made from diatoms which are the fossilized remains of a type of hard shelled algae (basically seaweed). So the question is do you consider diatoms animals and if you do is there a statute of limitations because these are all very ancient diatom shells. I think most people consider diatoms to be plants, but I leave that determination up to you. \r\n\r\nOccasionally we do use honey in our beer, but when we do it is clearly labeled as having honey in it. We use no milk, eggs, gelatin, isinglass, sea shells (unless the shells of algae qualifies) or bone char.\"\r\n\r\nCompany Email:\r\n\"If we happen to do more exotic specialized ideas that include any such products, we will specify what is being incorporated.

To my knowledge, both of those are vegan friendly. Feel free to pass along any info that you find which may say otherwise.\r\n \r\nThe only issue I have run into with regards to vegan 'unfriendly' COOP beers is in our canned products. We filter these products with sheets that contain a small amount of DE or diatomaceous earth. These are fossilized remains that aid in making clear beer. I believe it was on the barnivore site a while back that I dug into the DE debate. From what I remember, some sources say 'yay', while other oppose. In my opinion, fossilized remains of anything are a bit of stretch to be non-vegan, but I guess it depends on how strict you are.\"\r\n",

"notes": "Company email (February 2013):\r\n\"I was just looking at the site [Barnivore] and noticed some of our seasonal ales are listed there as 'not vegan'. You may need to wait until the brewers return, but some of them may be vegan. Here's what I can verify for certain:\r\nCrannóg Backhand of God Stout: Vegan\r\nCrannóg Red Branch Irish Ale: Not Vegan\r\nCrannóg Gael's Blood Potato Ale: Not Vegan (because of isinglass… not human blood haha)\r\nCrannóg Insurrection IPA: Not Vegan\"\r\n\r\nCompany email (February 2013):\r\n\"Unfortunately the big bosses here (Rebecca and Brian) are on vacay for the next couple weeks, but having talked to them about this very topic last week, I feel confident in fielding your question. We have four main beers that we brew year round. Of those, only our Backhand of God Stout is vegan (isinglass is used in the other three). Crannog Ales is a small Certified Organic Brewery in Sorrento, BC and is not manufactured anywhere else in the world!\"\r\n\r\nCompany email (August 2012):\r\n\"We use Isinglass as a fining in all our beers EXCEPT the Backhand of God Stout. We do not use any animal ingredients in any of our beers otherwise, except for the occasional cask which uses honey, and which is stated on the beer. You are highly unlikely to get any cask ales from us anyway, so not to worry about it.\r\n \r\nWe respect all life, animal or vegetable. Our ethic is to live and brew in a way which supports a vital ecosystem, including livestock, wild animals, insects, soil biota, vegetation etc. We are aware that our lives depend on the lives of everything around us, regardless of class or family.\"\r\n\r\nCompany email (March 2012)\r\n- We are certified organic - all our beers, all the time. No non-organic ingredients.\r\n- We are fully committed to ethical and responsible farming and brewing. Our brewery is as close to zero-waste as current recycling availability allows, we have reduced our water use to 1/8 that of most breweries, and we re-use our wastewater on the farm. We have reduced packaging and re-use almost everything in the brewery. Both the farm and the brewery are certified organic, and our primary focus is to build and regenerate the eco-system within which we operate. We build soil through our brewery and farm processes.\r\n- We use isinglass as a processing aid in all our beers except the Backhand of God Stout. It is a processing aid that drops out of the beer before packaging, and is not present in the final beer.\r\n- We do not pasteurize or filter our beers, so that they remain live products with active yeast and all the flavour we work so hard to put there in the first place.\r\n- We use honey in some of our seasonal ales, indicated in the name or description of the beer. The honey comes from hives on the farm, which surrounds the brewery. (By the way, honey is produced by bees, it's not an \"animal\" ingredient. Just like wool is produced by sheep, they are not harmed in the shearing, and their health depends on being shorn annually!)\r\n- We continue to institute energy-saving methods in the brewery, from water re-use to heat-on-demand systems so that our footprint remains sustainable.\r\n- We raise livestock on the farm, as their manure and grazing assists in the creation of healthy soil and a viable eco-system. Without their input, our soil would become depleted and we would need to use chemical fertilizers! Responsible and ethical livestock rearing is extremely important to us. \r\n\r\nWe manufacture only in our own brewery, nowhere else. Why? Because the whole focus of what we do is sustainability, and exporting/outsourcing is simply not environmentally sustainable.\r\n\r\nTherefore, the only beer that we make that adheres to your requirements would be the Backhand of God Stout, which uses no isinglass. It is widely available throughout southern BC - there's a list of where you can get it on our website.",

But you are safe with the dry cider, and if you need it a bit sweeter try adding a little of our apple juice which is utterly natural.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nCompany email:\r\n\"I can assure you that we do not use any animal ingredients in our ciders...other than crushing fruit that is completely naturally grown without the use of any chemicals, which therefore has some insects/caterpillars on/in it! We do not process it beyond the crushing and pressing, and it is made in wooden ex-rum/whiskey barrels, and we do not filter it. Some of our bottles ciders are sweetened with a wine sweetener (saccharine/glycerine), but our dry cider is utterly natural. We make all our ciders on our farm from fruit grown locally, within about 10 miles. I’m afraid the down side to that is that we only sell locally, but can arrange to send cases of 12 bottles. If you can make it down this way you are welcome to visit and taste our ciders/perry.\"\r\n\r\nCompany email:\r\n\"Thank you for your enquiry. We do not use any animal ingredients in any of our ciders, apart from any beasties that might have been in the apples!...It is all from unsprayed orchards so we have no control over who/what has got to the apples before us! Other than that, we simply crush the apples, press the pulp and ferment the juice in oak barrels using the wild yeasts present on the apples.  Nothing else is added. Some barrels clear and some remain cloudy, depending on variety of cider fruit used. We use a range of old cider varieties from traditional orchards in Gloucestershire.  Hope this helps.\"",

Please be advised that Red Stripe does not contain any animal by-products, dairy, eggs and fish. However we do not test for the presence of these ingredients in any of our products.\r\nRegarding your other inquiry; it is our policy not to provide proprietary information to external parties for private or commercial purposes.\"\r\n\r\nCompany email (September 2014):\r\n\"In answer to your query however, we do use isinglass, a by product of the fishing industry, for fining our Red Stipe beer and Dragon Stout. Isinglass is used widely in the brewing industry although it is extensively refined before use. Its sole purpose is as a fining agent to help remove yeast from our beer, while we accept that some minor traces of isinglass may subsequently remain in the finished product.\"\r\n\r\nCompany email (November 2012):\r\n\"Isinglass is occasionally used in production of Red Stripe in Jamaica but is not used when product is brewed on contract in Europe. You can tell where the product was brewed by the contact details on the can itself. \r\n\r\nIsinglass, which is a by-product of the fishing industry, is used as a fining agent in some beers i.e. used during processing to clarify beer. There should be little residue in the finished beer. Findings are removed (by sedimentation and centrifugation) so vegetarians may consider that Red Stripe brewed in Jamaica is not suitable for them.\"\r\n\r\n[Editor's Note] I don't know what is causing the confusion? Could the North American enquiry line be giving a consistently different response than the European enquiry line? To be safe I've left all Red Stripe as NOT vegan-friendly.\r\n\r\nCompany email (May 2012):\r\n\"Isinglass is occasionally used in production of Red Stripe in Jamaica but is not used when product is brewed on contract in Europe. You can tell where the product was brewed by the contact details on the can itself.\" [be aware that it is possible for Jamaican Red Stripe to be imported and therefore could be available in other countries.]\r\n\r\nAs you can see, the answers go back and forth on this\r\n\r\nCompany email: March 2012\r\n\r\nIn regards to your inquiry, please be advised that Red Stripe is not considered to be Vegan. We apologize for any inconvenience this may cause.

Just as an update, as a regulatory requirement Red Stripe for Australia, in particular, had always been produced without any finings (fish products. Since last year, the use of finings in the manufacture of ALL Red Stripe beer has ceased.  This was therefore the premise on which my response to Brad was based on September 1, 2009. Note that emails from Brad have been routed directly to my attention at Red Stripe Diageo in Jamaica and we both have been in discussion since 2008, before the change in the manufacture/processing of Red Stripe beer was initiated.\"\r\n\r\nCompany email (Yvonne.Haynes@Diageo.com) : Sept 2009\r\n\"Red Stripe has completely changed their filtering process and no longer uses any filtering aid. So you can now start drinking our brand.\"\r\n\r\nCompany email (Redstripe@consumer-care.net): Sept 2009\r\n\"In regards to your inquiry, please note that Red Stripe is not vegan.\"\r\n\r\nSept 2008:\r\nThis is one of those cases where international distribution and licensing can lead to different manufacturing processes (or just plain old wrong answers) - when in doubt, double check (and send us the responses!)\r\n\r\nWe're waiting for confirmation from Well & Youngs as Alastair didn't forward the email. \r\nAlastair says:\r\n\"Just to say that Red Stripe is suitable for vegans in the UK, I recently contacted Well & Youngs Brewery and received an email back confirming its suitability for vegans.\"\r\n\r\nCompany email:\r\nIn regards to your inquiry, please be advised that at this time, Red Stripe is not Vegan-friendly.

On the flip side, one could say our partners at Ipswich helped slightly reduce reliance on animal products, but I'm betting the facility they bought them from were only getting bigger, newer ones. Actually, now that you've got me thinking, is there any possibility there are animal products in the glue used for the labels? On that one, I'd be stymied. I'll ask Ipswich, but dollars to donuts they would just shrug.\r\n\r\nAs such, we only have the one processing facility, so there's no concern there.\"\r\n",

"notes": "Note from Kevin (June 2015):\r\n\"I have a vegan friend coming over later today and I wanted to offer him an Alhambra Especial 1925 (a nice blond spanish beer that i recommend you try if you like blond beers..) and I came upon the confusing entry for Estrella Damm (which is not a very good beer in my opinion). Maybe I can help. Your webpage for that beer reflects that your readers are very confused due to the fact that the manufacturer was written in spanish (which makes sense because it was from an online discussion in a spanish forum), but the manufacturer's statement is perfectly clear and direct. Estrella Damm is vegan.\r\n\r\nAccording to the response from the manufacturer, which appears first in castellano (what you would call \"spanish\", used in all parts of Spain) and lower on the page in catalán (the language of Catalunya, where Barcelona is located), Estrella Damm does not contain or utilize any animal ingredients or animal-derivative products in its manufacturing process. They state that in the very first sentence, but then they go on to elaborate to you, kind beer drinker, that fish-derivatives were once, at one time in beer history, used in some breweries in the world (mostly in ENGLAND), but that this is an outdated technology and has been abandoned probably or nearly completely. \r\n\r\nThey then state the beer may contain a single-celled fungus known as Saccharomyces, depending on whether it is filtered. What is that? Is it an animal, is it dangerous? No reason to be concerned, as they are merely referring to Brewer's Yeast (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saccharomyces), which comes as no surprise since it is BEER we are talking about.\r\n\r\nA different but equally important issue for all animal-loving beer drinkers (like me, I am not a vegan but I am an animal-rights person) is that some beer companies have participated in or promoted events that use animals as entertainment. In Spain, this would typically be circuses, zoos, bull-fighting, etc. The forum referenced on your webpage has a comment written in 2010 in which someone states that Estrella Damm did some kind of zoo-discount on the bottle at some point... (i guess it was kind of like how Coca-Cola has reduced admission prices to Six Flags if you bring the can to the amusement park...and of course Six Flags has had safari-zoo type of areas in their parks...)\r\n\r\nAnyway, hope that helps. There is no doubt that, according to the statement, Estrella Damm beers (all of them) are vegan.\"\r\n\r\nCompany email (May 2015):\r\n\"Hiya! I noticed that the entry on your site for Estrella is rather confusing and perhaps lost in translation so I messaged them on their Facebook page and they replied that Estrella is indeed vegan. Yay :-)\r\nhttps://m.facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=1057463110935188&id=727569583924544&notif_t=feed_comment&ref=bookmark\"\r\n\r\n**** Editor's Note: Due to several contradictory responses and the possibility information being \"lost in translation\", Barnivore has listed Estrella Damm as 'Not Vegan Friendly' to be on the safe side. Please use the information below to determine whether or not you are comfortable with purchasing this product. ****\r\n\r\nNote from Manu (October 2012):\r\n\"I just discovered your amazing website and, checking the beers of my country, I found that there's some controversy about Estrella Damm being vegan or not. Since that's the most common beer in Catalunya and I'm vegan (and beer lover), I'd like to try to shed some light on the topic.\r\n\r\nIn the spanish \"foro vegetariano\" there was some topic about it (http://www.forovegetariano.org/foro/archive/index.php/t-35611.html) where one of the users got a direct answer from the company:\r\n\r\n\"En Damm para la fabricación de nuestras cervezas no se utilizan componentes ni aditivos de origen animal.\r\nDerivados del pescado, en forma de gelatinas o colas, se habían utilizado históricamente sobre todo en algunas cervecerías inglesas como clarificantes de la cerveza antes de la filtración pero hoy en día esta práctica está bastante abandonada ya que las técnicas de filtración han mejorado muchísimo.\r\nLa cerveza se obtiene a partir de la fermentación de un mosto gracias a levaduras de la familia Saccharomyces (hongo unicelular) que pueden estar presentes en el producto final en función del tipo de cerveza del que se trate (filtrada o sin filtrar).\r\n\r\nReciba un cordial saludo\r\nCristina Rios.\r\nRble. Calidad Exterior\r\nGRUPO DAMM\"\r\n\r\nTranslation (by myself):\r\n\r\n\"In Damm we don't use components or additives from animal origin for the manufacturing of our beers.\r\nFish derivates, in form of jellies or colas, were used historically, specially in some English breweries, as a beer clarifier before the filtering but nowadays this practice is quite abandoned since filtering techniques have evolved a lot.\r\nThe beer is obtained from the fermentation of a wort by yeast from the Saccharomyces family (unicellular fungus) which can be present in the final product depending on the type of beer in question (filtered or unfiltered).\"\r\n\r\nSo... It seems in the end Estrella Damm is vegan friendly (at least that's something, since they are not worker friendly at all... But I guess that's another story).\"\r\n\r\nNote from Ryan (August 2012):\r\n\"Okay, this is a little complicated. I can see where Miguel is coming from as it does almost seem to suggest that it MIGHT contain fish products, as the phrasing is awkward. \r\n\r\nEssentially what it says is \r\n\r\nFish and fish-based products, except\r\n\r\na. Fish gelatine used to carry vitamins or preparations of carotenoids\r\n\r\nb. Fish gelatine used as clarifier in beer or wine\r\n\r\nNow ordinarily I'd agree that this was something to be concerned about, but looking at the date of that it was from 2009, and I believe the other message you have on the website, which directly contradicts this, is more recent. It's a tricky one.\"\r\n\r\nNote from Miguel (July 2012):\r\n\"You have been change again this beer to Vegan friendly. It is wrong. You can find attached a certificate in which is written the opposite, but it is a bit tricky to understand, also in Spanish.\" [Correction (August 2013): This is in Catalan, not Spanish]\r\n\r\nCompany email (June 2012): (email sent to Estrella Damm)\r\n\"A Grup Damm no es fan servir derivats del peix ni altres additius d'origen animal. \r\nEls derivats del peix en forma de gelatines o colas s'havien fet servir històricament a cerveseria com a clarificants de la cervesa abans de la filtració. Avui en dia, aquesta pràctica està molt abandonada degut a que les tècniques de filtració han millorat moltíssim.\"\r\n\r\n[Translation by MC]: \"At Damm Group, products derived from fish and other additives of animal origin are not used. Fish derivatives in the form of gelatins or glues were formerly used to clarify the beer before filtration. Today, this practice has been widely abandoned because filtration techniques have improved greatly.\"\r\n\r\nCorrection (April 2012):\r\n\"the company attached me this form and show that they use jelly fish. I know that it´s dificult to translate but you need to translate all the words in the 4 point. At the end of this line the use the word \"salvo\" that the meaning in english is \"except\". This part of the form is really convoluted, also in spanish.\"\r\n\r\nCompany email (March 2012):\r\nEditor's note: Company email was extensive, but does not mention the use of any animal products.",

Beer Fest are vegan friendly: Stone Hammer Light, Pilsner & Dark Ale. No animal products in the ingredients or filtering (we use diatomaceous earth to filter).\r\n \r\nWhen we do CASK beer (which will NOT be available at the Beer Fest) then yes, we do use isinglass. The only current exception to this is at Castros Lounge in Toronto, who request our casks with no isinglass, so they are therefore vegan friendly.\r\n \r\nFinally, none of our products are made anywhere else. However, we do make MacLean's Pale Ale at our brewery for MacLean's Ales, north of Mount Forest, ON. This beer will not be available at the Beer Fest and is made, filtered, and casked like our other beers, including the Castro's exception.\"",

"notes": "Company Email:\r\n\"Neat questions.  So here are some answers:\r\n1.  We do not use any animal products in any of our beers.\r\n2.  Our bottled beers available at the LCBO are Hoptical Illusion Almost Pale Ale, Smashbomb Atomic IPA, Netherworld Cascadian Dark Ale, Flying Monkeys Amber Ale, and Antigravity Light Ale.  \r\n3.  Our filters use diatemaceous earth (DE)--a filtration sand comprised of sedimentary rock which may contain the crushed skeletons of prehistoric critters. Is that bad? We do not use isinglass or gelatin.\r\n4.  We also us filtration powder that is DE and a powdery perlite (crushed alumino-silica rock or naturally occuring silicon dioxcide).\r\n5.  Our casks are unfiltered, and unless we call something a honey beer, there is no honey. We made a cask of Smash Jezebel HoneyBomb for C'est What? last spring, but it was just a one-off, specialty experiment which was a sweetened riff on our  Smashbomb Atomic IPA.  That's the only honey we've ever used.  Honestly, we didn't love it.\r\n6. We never use eggs.  \r\n7. We have never brewed a milk stout with lactose --the unfermentable sugar found in milk.  So NO to milk.\r\n8. We brew all our own beer, ourselves,  right here in downtown Barrie. None of our beers are contract brewed or produced off this premises.\r\n9.  We do have some new beers coming down the pipe with turbinado sugar, maple sugar, Madagascar Bourbob Vanilla pods, beers filtered through oak staves . . .  everything I'm thinking of  are all of plant-origins.  Hey, I'm thinking we're vegan!\r\n\r\nInterestingly enough, we will soon (by mid 2012) be labelling all allergens in our beers.  Maybe a vegan notification might be useful, too.  If we have to design new labels, why not?\r\n\r\nHope this info was useful, and don't hesitate to ask more questions.  I do not know much about what counts as officially vegan, but I'm developing the idea that our beers are all natural and safe.  We do use varieties of organic hops and nonGMO'd malts.  Not all hop varieties are grown organically, but we try to get them whenever we can.\"\r\n\r\nMore details:\r\n\"None of our LCBO bottled beers have sugar in them.  Barley, hops, water, and yeast.  That's all. We get all our flavours from the varieties of hops and the different types of roast and malted barley or different strains of yeast. \r\n\r\nOf course, that being said, Antigravity has undergone a recipe tweaking recently, so I better check on it.  They're brewing a batch with a different, sweeter  malt, but I don't think anything else was added.  Adjunct or additives are not our style.   And, yes, we do brew a light ale --for slow-pitch softball and lawn mowing -- but the nice hoppy craftier brews you'd find at C'est What? are all vegan approved.  \r\n\r\nOf the beers in the LCBO, Hoptical Illusion Almost Pale Ale, Netherworld Cascadian Dark Ale, and Flying Monkeys Amber Ale are definitely vegan according to your criterion.  Smashbomb Atomic IPA would be vegan, too.  No adjunct or additives in Smashbomb --just buckets and buckets of hops!  You can get that one on tap in a lot of micro-friendly pubs.\r\n\r\nThe casks would be a different story and should be evaluated on a case by case basis.  Any info on Belgian Candi Sugar (yes, \"candi\" spelled with an \"i\"). It's brown and raw-looking, like hardened molassass, and it does have that rich molassass-y flavour.   C'est What? will be getting a 16-18%ABV Imperial Baltic Porter from us called Divinity in the next few weeks, and I know it has Belgian Candi Sugar in it to help get the alcohol content up there.  It tastes like a port --delicious!  The Belgian Candi Sugar is the only wild card for you in that one.  Hope you can drink it, because it is a whole new level in craft beer!\"",

I mentioned their beers are listed as vegan on Barnivore, and Sam told me this is incorrect. Their cask ales currently contain isinglass finings, so are not suitable for vegans nor vegetarians. However, their bottled beers have no finings, just some added sugar, so are suitable for vegans and vegetarians.\"\r\n\r\nNote from Andy (December 2013)\r\n\r\n\"I visited The Hope pub in Stockport recently. Their help when asking “the” question was good as, along with a friendly welcome,  we didn’t get the “whatever the heck is one of those” look.\"\r\n",

We do not use any animal products in our filtration.  All of our products are produced on-site in Grand Rapids, Michigan.\"\r\n\r\nCompany email: February 2010\r\n\"Yes indeed all of our non chocolate beers are indeed vegan.  We have been pleased with our decision and it appears that our customers are also happy.  Breakfast Stout, Kentucky Breakfast Stout and Canadian Breakfast Stout are currently the only chocolate beers we make.  We occasionally do a honey beer on tap here at the pub only and we once made a beer onsite called Hole Mole that also had chocolate.  Other than that all of our beers are vegan.\" \r\n\r\nCompany email: December 2009\r\n\"Thanks for your interest, and Yes we have successfully integrated a vegan fining agent into our brewing process.  This not only makes us feel a lot better about our beers, but has given us incredible clarity.  I can't believe that anyone would use anything else.  It\r\ndoes cost us more, and we had to develop processes for its integration, but we feel great about telling people that our (non-milk) beers are all vegan.

Thanks for\r\nsupporting Founders!\"\r\n\r\nCompany email: March 2009\r\n\"We are struggling with this very subject now and are almost completely vegan.  We absolutely want and plan to be vegan as soon as possible.  We were told by a supplier that our fining agent was vegan so we though we were, but found out from the manufacturer that not to be true.

We are currently doing trials of vegan finings and will soon be completely vegan.  <b>All of our dark beers however (with the exception of Breakfast Stout and KBS which have chocolate in them) are vegan as we do not use finings in them (Porter, Imperial Stout, Oatmeal Stout).</b>  We’ll get there soon… I hope that this info is helpful.\"\r\n\r\nAlso from March 2009:\r\nCompany Email via Kevin M\r\n\"Although we do not filter our products we have used some of these agents in our beers.

The most substantial the Bierhefe during the beer production is, which is out-filtered before the filling the beer, added one. Compound ones added with the production of our products are not used. Production auxiliary materials, which are used e.g. with clarifying the beer, are missing also on animal basis. Thus e.g. for the filtration of the beer petrified flint algae are used, which are after a fuel process husbands. All other filtration aids are plastics, which do not remain also in the beer. We can guarantee a 100%ige separation here. The packing materials, e.g. labels, correspond to the normal German standard, where also no animal products are contained of our knowledge. In summary we can say from our position that we would like to call our JEVER products vegan.

This style of beer will be served from either a hand pump or direct from the cask and is not considered as suitable for Vegans or strict Vegetarians.\r\n \r\nOur bottled ,canned and keg beers are brewery conditioned and then filtered with inorganic filter aids. We do not use Isinglass or any other animal derived products in either the production or processing of these beers and are normally considered suitable for Vegans and Vegetarians. The only exception to this is our Organic Honeydew beer which has Organic honey as part of it's ingredients and is accepted by most Vegetarians but not by Vegans.\r\n \r\nI hope that the above enables you to enjoy both the Gales and the Fullers range of beers in either their bottled, canned or keg format.\"\r\n\r\nCOMPANY EMAIL: 2008\r\n\"In response to your questions, not all Fuller's beers are suitable for vegans.  \r\nFuller's cask ales contain the fish product 'isinglass' finings for settling the beer, thus making them not suitable.

"notes": "Company email:\r\nMy name is Dave and I'm the brewer for the Gardner Ale House in Gardner, Massachusetts.  We have a 7 bbl brewery here and serve beer on site only (no distributing), although we do fill half-gallon jugs to go. \r\n \r\nThe only ingredients we use here are natural and we don't use honey (although we have considered it).  The ingredients that I have used up to this point are as follows:  barley, hops, yeast, water, Irish moss, and unpasteurized apple cider.\r\n \r\nWe don't filter our beer at all.  We use no isinglass, no gelatin, no bone char, etc.  If you are wondering about Irish moss, it is all natural, made from seaweed.  Irish moss \"is a species of red algae (Chondrus crispus) which grows abundantly along the rocky parts of the Atlantic coast of Europe and North America\". ( from Wikipedia)  We use Irish moss as a kettle coagulant.  Carageenan is the protein found in Irish moss which makes it useful to us brewers.  Carageenan carries a net negative charge on its particle.  Most of the proteins that leach out of the malted barley during the mashing process carry a net positive charge.  Adding Irish moss in the boil (the sweet liquid, wort, is boiled for stability and hop utilization) causes the positively charged proteins to coagulate together around the negatively charged carageenan particles.  This causes protein \"clumps\" to form which then have a much easier time falling to the bottom of the tank.  So, you could call Irish moss an all natural way to help clarify beer.  Every brewer I know uses it to some degree.\r\n \r\nAnyway, we at the Gardner Ale House take pride that our beer is not only all natural, but unfiltered as well, leaving the beer as wholesome and fresh as could possibly be.  Our beer might not always be perfectly clear as a result, but the flavor is unbeatable, and it is nice to know that we can call our beer vegan.  I hope this helps your list.  By the way, right now we have 6 of our own fresh house brews on tap: Facelift IPA, Oma's Altbier, Naked Stout, Snow Slaker Winter Lager, Summer's End Kolsch, and William Tell's Apple Ale.  Cheers!!",

Some vegan organizations such as the Vegan Society and the American Vegan Society do not consider honey suitable, other vegan organizations such as Vegan Action and Vegan Outreach regard honey consumption as a matter of personal choice.\"\r\n\r\nCompany email:\r\nThanks for taking the time to contact High Falls Brewing Company.

We use no soy ingredients, and currently only our Grapefruit IPA uses a corn ingredient.  Due to concerns about the potential use of GMOs in corn maltodextrin, we are preparing to replace it with certified organic non-GMO tapioca maltodextrin.  We cannot make that switch until we have used up all of our cans printed with corn maltodextrin listed in the ingredients. All of our other beers are GMO-free and corn-free.\r\n\r\nWe add no preservatives, stabilizers, or fillers.  The only off-label additives are Irish moss (a whole and natural seaweed) to precipitate proteins in the boil, which are filtered out in the kettle, and trace amounts of a few vitamins, minerals, and micronutrients to support the health of our yeast and ensure rapid and consistent fermentation.\r\n\r\nAll of our beers are very “low tech”; we don’t filter or pasteurize, we don’t add any finings, we don’t use any artificial ingredients.  Our packaged beers are all vegan as well, using no honey or animal products.\r\n\r\nIn addition, our malts are produced in a dedicated gluten-free malting facility, and the entire supply chain is gluten-free—no shared equipment or storage facilities!  We can trace our malts all the way back to the very field the grains are grown in.  We take cross-contamination very seriously here at Ghostfish.\"",

We as a brewery currently comply with the German purity law of Reinheitsgebot (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reinheitsgebot ) .

Once a Granite City brewery uses one of our yeast starter batches, they then re-use the yeast produced from their fermentation for several generations so only the first batch had a tiny (if any) amount of Isinglass in it.\r\n\r\nI'm assuming from your Twitter handle that your are asking in regard to vegetarian issues.  I've had this discussion often with vegetarian, beer-loving friends of mine.  Here is some interesting numbers about the amount of Isinglass used in our beer:\r\n\r\nThe percentage of Isinglass used in the yeast propagation is 0.012%.  That 0.012% is then added to 465 gallons of wort to produce beer.  Then the yeast (along with the Isinglass) settles out and is removed.  Are there perhaps molecules of animal protein somewhere in the beer?  Perhaps.  I would argue that you get more animal protein by sitting in a leather chair.  \r\n\r\nIf you are a vegetarian, I respect your desire to avoid animal products in any amount.  If you are okay with the possible microscopic amount that may be in some batches, then just be sure to stick with our lagers.  The Ales are not filtered so we use gelatin to settle the yeast.  Again, gelatin is used as a catalyst in settling so by definition isn't considered an ingredient as it is removed from the final product.\"",

We are listing their beer as NOT vegan-friendly at this point, but please use your own discretion.]\r\n\r\nCompany email (December 2014):\r\n\"All of our beers available in standard packaging, such as six or twelve packs, are free of animal products except for our Cypress Honey Lager which contains Fraser Valley Honey.  In regards to our Small Batch program which is available in 650mL bottles, all of our currently made beers are free of animal products. However, if you read the label it will generally tell you what special ingredients went into a Small Batch bottle aside from the basic key ingredients of water, malt, hops & yeast.  For example, our Pumpkining Pumpkin ale which includes pumpkin puree and spices states, “Pumpkin flavours and spices emerge to create a truly twisted ale.”  Our kegged products are the same that are available in the smaller packaging of bottles and cans.  However, all of our casked products contain isinglass.  All of our beers may contain yeast and our unfiltered beers such as our Hey Day Hefeweizan contain yeast.  The water we use is filtered with activated carbon derived from charcoal of which origin we cannot verify.  Lastly our beer is exclusively brewed and packaged at our facilities in Canada.\"\r\n\r\nCompany email (December 2012):\r\n\"Of the products you listed we use diatomaceous earth to filter our beer and charcoal to filter our brewing water, I have been unable to verify the source of the charcoal for you.\"\r\n\r\nCompany email (December 2011):\r\n\"Other than the Honey Lager the only beers we make that are processed with an animal product are the Limited Release beers that are in casks.

We do not use any of the filter aids that you’re talking about here at Great Lakes , so our beers are definitely vegan friendly!  I would be careful as you begin your exploration into the beer world as there are many craft brewers that do use them. I would be especially careful if you go to a place that is serving cask-conditioned beer.  This is a very popular way to serve beer these days but the use of finings is very common with these beers.  We do a cask here at Great Lakes on occasion and do not use any, so if you’re looking to try one, keep an eye out on our website.  Thanks again!  I hope you find some of our beers to your liking!\r\n\r\nFrom Greer:\r\n\"I called them directly and asked to speak to their Brewmaster, and they transferred me to some fellow named Mark.  He confirmed that they DO use honey in their Christmas Ale, but seemed perplexed when I asked if any other animal ingredients were used in the clarifying process. I then said, \"Gelatin? Isinglass?\"  His retort was, \"Um...no? We use a synthetic clarifier called PVPP\"  (which stands for polyvinylpolypyrrolidone, which also acts as a stabilizer).\"",

The sediment remains at the bottom of the cask and the clarified beer is served. There is therefore a possibility of trace amounts of isinglass being in the beer.\r\n\r\nWe do not recommend our beers to either vegans or vegetarians because of the use of isinglass as a clarifying aid but leave the decision whether to drink them up to the individual. \"\r\n\r\nNote from Brian\r\n\"Old Speckled Hen & Tanner's Jack say they're brewed at Morland brewery which is actually just part of Greene king, as well as Wexford Irish Creme Ale which is brewed by Greene King but really not even listed on their website.\"",

I asked them very specifically about Guinness Extra Stout in the bottle and even sent them pictures of the back label with product codes on it. Even though the rep on the phone said that it was vegan friendly, the rep via email says they dont brew in New Brunswick and that they are not responsible for this beer. \r\n\r\nThey instructed me to contact DIAGEO. when i contacted DIAGEO (the proper distributor for this beer according to the label), they gave me the generic response that GUINNESS uses isinglass in their beer. I replied to them for more specific info about the exact product i was speaking about and also sent the the pictures of the label with product info. They have not gotten back to me yet.\r\n\r\nVery confusing info from Labatt's, but now i have in writing that they deny ownership of this specific product, even though the rep on the phone contradicted this information... annoying.\r\n\r\nHopefully DIAGEO responds with more info.\"\r\n\r\nNote from Matt (March 2013):\r\n\"The main confusion for me here is the fact that none of the packaging for Guinness in NA say Labbatt's brewing anywhere on it (also the Moosehead info which confuses things, cant even tell if they actually brew Guinness anymore), so i wanted to confirm what version of Extra Stout was brewed where.\r\n\r\nas follows:\r\n\r\nI specifically asked Labatt's in the email about Guinness Extra stout in the bottle brewed by Guinness Brewing Company, New Brunswick, Canada (this is what's printed on the bottle label, there is no mention of Labatt's on the packaging at all, although they are the manufacturers).\r\n\r\nI received this email in response [see below] but it sounded very formulaic and didn't mention Guinness specifically. I called Labatt's to speak with a rep and at first they gave me the generic answer that they do in fact use isinglass in the process. Then I asked very clearly and specifically about bottled Extra Stout brewed and bottled in New Brunswick. After checking for me the rep was able to very clearly confirm that this product, brewed in New Brunswick, didn't not use isinglass in it's production and was in fact suitable for vegans. whew!\"\r\n\r\nCompany email (March 2013):\r\n\"You will be pleased to hear that we do not use any animal products in our beer or the production of it. \r\n \r\nThe fine beers we brew (and import) are brewed with these all-natural ingredients:  water, barley malt, hops, yeast, and cereal grains.\r\n \r\nThe water we use is drawn from the municipal drinking supply and carbon filtered for astounding purity.  Our brewing water must free of any taste, color, or aroma before brewing.\r\n \r\nBarley malt is the “soul” of beer.  Our beers are brewed with pale two or six row barley malt.  Roasted barley gives the color to our beers – lightly roasted barley makes pale golden beers like Labatt Blue or Budweiser.  For Keith’s Red we use barley roasted a little longer, until the sugars start to caramelize.  Roast them yet more?  Keith’s Dark.\r\n \r\nHops are the female flower bud of a perennial climbing vine, and are known as the “spice” of beer.  Hops are added in different stages of the brew kettle’s boil to give the beer aroma, bitterness, and to balance the flavor. \r\n \r\nYeast is the life of the brewing process.  We use our own pure-cultured yeast strains for fermentation – the yeast breaks down sugars into carbon dioxide and alcohol.  Our lagers use a bottom-fermenting yeast for a crisper, cleaner flavor.  Ales use a top-fermenting yeast for a more fruity, floral, lingering notes.\r\n \r\nMost of our beers are also brewed with a cereal grain, also known as an adjunct.  Some are brewed with corn for a sweeter taste.  Some use rice for a crisp, clean finish. \r\n \r\nBeyond this, some beers use special flavorings or spices for a truly unique flavor – like the essence of lime found in Bud Light Lime, or the coriander and citrus peel found in Keith’s White.\"\r\n\r\nCompany email (October 2012):\r\n[from Labatt who brews Guiness Extra Stout in Canada] \"You will be pleased to hear that we do not use any animal products in our beer or the production of it.\"\r\n\r\nCompany email (Feb 2012)\r\nI am writing to you in response to your recent email regarding whether Guinness and  it's suitability for Vegans.\r\n\r\nIn answer to your query however, we do use isinglass, a by product of the fishing industry, for fining all Guinness brewed beers. Isinglass is used widely in the brewing industry although it is extensively refined before use.

We sincerely apologize for any inconvenience this may cause.\"\r\n\r\nNote from William: March 2011 \r\n\"I know you have received conflicting information regarding the brewing of Guinness, and your level of exasperation is obvious from the Guinness entry.  Nonetheless, I tried to follow a logical thread that has been apparent from the beginning, when Guinness original explained that a certain product (Guinness Extra Stout for export to the U.S.) didn't use Isinglass as a fining agent and was vegan.  How could that be, I asked myself.  Well, I noticed that the Guinness Extra Stout was brewed in Canada.  So, I did some research and found that many of the online commentators at beer sites were wrong. Moosehead, not Labatt's, brewed it for the U.S.  \r\n\r\nThus, I contacted the actual brewers of Guinness Extra Stout that exported here, and their response follows: consumerinquiries@moosehead.ca\r\n\"Hello William,\r\nThank you for your inquiry. We do in fact brew delicious Guinness Extra Stout for export to the States right here in Canada’s most Irish city, Saint John. We do not make use of isinglass in any of our brewing processes, export or domestic. \r\nConsumer Affairs Coordinator\r\nMoosehead Breweries Ltd.\"\r\n\r\nCompany email: (pamela.daly@diageo.com) March 2011\r\n\"All Guinness brands are free from animal matter.

To the strict Vegan, this would be considered an animal product and therefore unsuitable. \"\r\n\r\nCompany Email (guinness@consumer-care.net) : May 2009\r\n\"In reference to your inquiry, we do not have confirmation of Guinness 250th Anniversary stout Edition to be considered Vegan.  Isinglass, a fish product, is used during the clarification process as a magnet to get rid of excess yeast. To the strict Vegan, this would be considered an animal product and therefore unsuitable for Guinness products.  Since this applies to Guinness products, it is more likely that this also applies to the Guinness 250th Anniversary stout Edition.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nMORE FROM THE BARNIVORE ARCHIVES:\r\n....Jan 2009\r\n\"In reference to your inquiry, isinglass, a fish product, is used during the clarification process as a magnet to get rid of excess yeast. To the strict Vegan, this would be an\r\nanimal product and unsuitable. I hope this helps. Once again, thank you for contacting\r\nus.\"\r\n\r\n....Jan 2009\r\nI showed them your web page and they explained (below is a small part of the email in case you want to quote it) that the extra stout is vegan and the draught is not, which explained the discrepancy. Hope that helps. James\r\n\r\n\"In regards to your inquiry, Guinness Extra Stout does not contain isinglass. Guinness Draught does contain isinglass in both bottles and the draught.\"\r\n\r\n.....Aug 2006:\r\n\r\nOur Consumer Relations department has informed us that the Guinness Extra Stout product that you will find in the North American market does not contain isinglass. I hope this is the answer you were looking for. If you have any other questions, please do not hesitate to ask.\r\n\r\n...But then we got this one in November:\r\n\r\nIn reference to your inquiry, isinglass, a fish product, is used during the clarification process as a magnet to get rid of excess yeast. To the strict Vegan, this would be an animal product and unsuitable.\r\n\r\nDid they not know about the Extra Stout?  Does this cancel out the previous message?  Who knows?\r\n\r\n...And then there's the standard reply:\r\n\r\nThank you for taking the time to contact us and for your interest in Guinness Draught nutritional information. In reference to your inquiry, isinglass, a fish product, is used during the clarification process as a magnet to get rid of excess yeast. To the strict Vegan, this would be an animal product and unsuitable. I hope this helps. Once again, thank you for contacting us.",

This means that often the beer will appear hazy or cloudy. This is intentional as we wish to keep all the flavour and goodness in the beer.

All ingredients are natural and from\r\nplant sources. No materials of animal sources are used. We don't use products of animal origin in the refining and filrating\r\nprocess. All our beer is filtered through kieselguhr filters (the calciferous\r\nskeletons of diatoms). When we first received questions from our vegan\r\nconsumers, this lead us to investigate: is a diatom a single cell animal or\r\nis it a plant? The American dictionary of biology says : Diatoms contain chlorophyll and are photosyntetic. In older classifications\r\nthey are identified as primitive plants. Because they are indeed plant-like in many respects, it is still common practice to use the term \"plant\".\r\n(Biological Science; Keeton; 3rd ed. (page 14))\r\nAccording to this description of the diatom, we can conclude that the cell is considered as a plant.\r\nThis makes it possible for us to call our beer vegan.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nNote from Karoliina (jan 2011) \r\n\"I contacted Desperados ( a tequila flavored beer) originated from france, and as I had to contact the french page, as the english one didn't seem to have a working e-mail this is the response I got from them, and they say that desperados does not contain any animal based product in the beer. as the beer is under the heineken group i can well believe that it might be vegan too then :)\"\r\n\r\nCompany Email: (Jan 2011) \r\n\"Nos produits ne contiennent aucun ingrédient d'origine animale.\"\r\n\r\nCompany email: Jan 2010\r\nThank you for your recent email message.

At this time, we have not applied for certification from any organizations, although we are confident our beers would qualify.\r\n \r\nStella Artois, brewed and bottled in Europe, is a European Pale Lager, with a pleasantly bitter taste and a refreshing finish.  Brewed with traditional malted barley, non-malted grain, and European hops, its drinkability creates a unique taste differentiation versus other European Lagers. She is a thing of beauty.\"\r\n\r\nWe've had some conflicting reports on this one, with the \"nays\" tending to come from other booze lists online as opposed to from direct company contact.  It's possible that the process differs by region for this one (the UK version of Stella may be different than the US, for example), \r\nbut we're waiting on confirmation.\r\n\r\nVia InBev US (info@ab-inbev.com): dec 2010\r\n\"There are no animal products or derivates to be found in any of our beers.\"\r\n\r\nVia InBev UK: July 2010\r\n\"The following AB-InBev beer brands sold in UK are suitable for vegans ( packaging is also vegan-friendly):\r\n>\r\n> Stella Artois\r\n> Stella 4%\r\n> Budweiser\r\n> Beck's\r\n> Beck's Vier\r\n> Beck's Blue\r\n> Brahma\r\n> Staropramen\r\n> Leffe\"\r\n\r\nVia InBev UK: June 2010\r\n\"The following AB-InBev beer brands sold in UK are suitable for vegans:\r\nStella Artois\r\nStella 4%\r\nBudweiser\r\nBeck's\r\nBeck's Vier\r\nBeck's Blue\r\nBrahma\r\nStaropramen\r\nLeffe\"\r\n\r\n\r\nAngela got this from the Australia rep, where Stella is distributed by Fosters:\r\nStella is NOT vegan friendly when made in Australia.\r\n  \r\nJessica got this from a North American rep, where Stella is distributed by Labatt:\r\n\r\nWe appreciate you taking the time to contact us.  You will be pleased to\r\nhear that we do not use any animal products in our beer or the production of it.  Thank you for your interest.\r\n\r\nNykle got the following information about Hoegaarden:\r\n\"The beer itself is vegan, it does not contain isinglass or gelatine. The labels are attached to the bottle with the following 'glue':\r\nEticol 700 and Eticol 419 : \"casein-glues\" = based on dairy-protein (= casein) and starch.\"\r\n\r\nMackeson on wikipedia:\r\nMackeson Stout is a dark sweet beer.

While the gelatin is removed and not in the beers, I understand that vegans want to know everything used in the process as well. While there are some synthetic alternatives to gelatin, the harsh chemicals used to produce these seem a less desirable option than a natural ingredient. We always seek to source locally and organic when possible, and use the best natural ingredients for all of our beers. Cheers!\"\r\n\r\nCompany email:\r\n\"Technically none of our beers can be considered vegan.  Using gelatin capture particulates while aging is a fairly standard brewing practice and one that we use as well.  In theory the gelatin settles with all the yeast in during fermentation.  Most of our beers are then filtered.  But we would not be surprised if trace amounts of gelatin were still found in the beer.  \r\nSo if you are a very strict vegan I would not recommend our products.\"\r\n\r\nCompany email:\r\n\"Thank you for getting in touch with us. When we first started in 2004 we\r\nused some gelatin, we experimented not using it, and found that we could\r\nstill produce the caliber of beer we're striving for without it.  Rest\r\nassured that Independence beers are vegetarian/vegan compliant.\"",

Only Malt, Hops, Yeast, Water, and real Vanilla.\"\r\n\r\nCompany email: May 2010\r\n\"Our Honey Weiss, Berry Weiss and Summer Shandy beers all contain a hint of honey. Of the ingredients you mention, honey is the only one we include in those three beers.

We're happy to tell you we do not use isinglass to settle the yeast in our beers. Typically, isinglass is used by folks when brewing ales. We brew mostly lagers--although we do not use it in the brewing of our special ale either.  Our beers do not contain additives or preservatives.  They are not formulated with any milk, egg, fish or shellfish (biogenic amines), tree nuts, peanuts or soybeans.  Leinenkugel's Honey Weiss, Berry Weiss, Sunset Wheat and Summer Shandy all use honey in the brewing process.  I hope this helps you and if you ever find yourself in our neck of the woods I hope you can stop and take a historic tour of the nation's 7th oldest brewery, we'll have a few cold ones waiting for you.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nCompany email:\r\nPlease know that our beers do not contain any additives or preservatives. Nor are they formulated with any milk, egg, fish or shellfish (biogenic amines), tree nuts, peanuts or soybeans. We sometimes use a little corn syrup and corn grits; both help to cut down on some of the harshness inherent in some of the malts and to make the beer smoother tasting.  We do not use isinglass.  Thank you for taking the time to contact us.\r\n\r\nSecond email:\r\nOur beers do not contain any additives or preservatives. They are not formulated with any milk, egg, fish or shellfish (biogenic\r\namines), tree nuts, peanuts or soybeans.\r\n\r\nLeinenkugel's Honey Weiss (yes we do use honey), Berry Weiss,\r\nCreamy Dark, and Leinenkugel Light are formulated with the use of wheat (Weiss) malt, a source of gluten. (Gluten and non-gluten proteins are found in wheat, rye, and barley.) It is likely that beers made with wheat may contain a higher level of gluten than traditional beers.\r\n\r\nYou can find the list of ingredients for our beers on our Beers'\r\npages in leinie.com. We sometimes use a little corn syrup and corn grits; both help to cut down on some of the harshness inherent in some of the malts and to make the beer smoother tasting.\r\n\r\nKnow that chocolate or caramel malts listed in our ingredients do not actually contain chocolate or caramel.  Their named that way due to the special roasting they go through.\r\n\r\nCary &  James also note that there's an update in the site's FAQ: http://www.leinie.com/faq.html#19\r\n\r\n\r\n",

Our filters are preloaded cartridges that utilize a blend of cellulose (plant material), diatomaceous earth (DE), and perlite (synthetic DE). Just in case you are not familiar with it, and to help aid in your determination, DE is essentially fossilized diatomes (single celled organisms). They find diatomaceous deposits in the earth of desert areas where ancient lakes once existed.

While our ingredients are all vegan (grain, hops, etc.), we filter the majority of our beers through diatomaceous earth.  This is a powdered form of fossilized algae.  From Wikipedia, “Diatomaceous earth consists of fossilized remains of diatoms, a type of hard-shelled algae..”  If the person is asking whether we use milk sugar or lactose in this beer, the answer is no.  it is only our filter media that does not pass the vegan test.\"\r\n\r\nCompany email (July 2012):\r\n\"we do not use animal ingredients in the beers that we bottle and ship nationally, but some pub beers in the past have been brewed using honey, but that’s not standard practice.  We do not use animal products in processing.  Our beers are all brewed at our breweries, where the processes are the same.\"\r\n\r\nCompany email:\r\n\"Thanks for your interest in the Kona Brewing Company.\r\nYes, our beers are vegan.\r\nPlease let me know if you have any other questions.\" \r\n\r\nDouble check:\r\n\"We do not use “any animal ingredients (such as milk, eggs, honey, etc) or are animal products used in the processing/filtration of the product (such as isinglass, gelatin, etc)”in our main/flagship beer styles.\r\nWe do however use some plant based finings (whirlfloc G & whirlfloc B) and some of our beers are filtered with diatomaceous earth.\"",

"notes": "Company email (July 2014):\r\n\"Respondiendo a tu consulta, los ingredientes que utilizamos para elaborar Kross son:\r\n- Cebada malteada (nacional para las maltas rubias e importadas de Alemania las maltas caramelo y tostadas), \r\n- Lúpulos, \r\n- Levadura \r\n- Agua. \r\n\r\nComo es sabido, la malta y el lúpulo son productos de origen vegetal, mientras que la levadura es un hongo microscópico. Otro que producto que utilizamos son sales de calcio (de origen mineral), que se utilizan para corregir la dureza de aguas muy blandas.\r\n\r\nDurante la filtración utilizamos tierras diatomeas, también un producto mineral que tiene como origen los esqueletos fósiles de algas microscópicas.\r\n\r\nAlgo que debes considerar es que en la industria cervecera se define como Ingrediente, a una materia prima que de hecho permanece en la cerveza, mientras que existen otros productos, como los clarificantes, que no se los considera ingredientes ya son removidos durante el proceso y no llegan al producto final. Ejemplos de estos son el Isinglass o la gelatina por ti mencionados.\r\n\r\nDe todas formas, nosotros no utilizamos isinglass, gelatina ni otros clarificantes de origen animal. Estos clarificantes se utilizan para acelerar la sedimentación de la levadura durante la maduración. En nuestro caso utilizamos levaduras que sedimentan bien de forma natural y además tenemos un tiempo de maduración prolongado para asegurar que la cerveza clarifique sin necesidad de apurarla.\r\n\r\nTampoco tenemos ninguna línea de cervezas que lleve miel.\r\nOtro tema que vale la pena aclarar es que a pesar de que en su origen las 'Cream Stout' llevaban suero de leche o recibían una adición de lactosa, nosotros no incorporamos ningún producto lácteo en nuestra stout, ni en ninguna de nuestras cervezas.\"\r\n\r\n[Google translation] \"In response to your query, the ingredients we use to produce Kross are: \r\n- Malted barley (domestic and imported blondes for the German caramel malts and roasted malts) \r\n- Hops, \r\n- Yeast \r\n- Water. \r\n\r\nAs is known, malt and hops are products of plant origin, while the yeast is a microscopic fungus. Another product use are calcium salts (of mineral origin), which is used to correct very soft water hardness. \r\n\r\nDuring filtration use diatomaceous earth, also a mineral product that has its origin in the fossil skeletons of microscopic algae. \r\n\r\nOne thing to consider is that the beer industry is defined as ingredient, a raw material fact remains in the beer, while other products, such as clarifiers, which are not considered ingredients and are removed during the process and not reach the final product. Examples are the isinglass or gelatin yourself mentioned. \r\n\r\nAnyway, we do not use isinglass, gelatin or other animal clarifiers. These clarifiers are used to accelerate the sedimentation of the yeast during ripening. In our case we use yeast that naturally settle well and also have a long maturation time to ensure that beer without having to rush you clarified. \r\n\r\nWe also have no line leading honey beers. \r\nAnother issue worth clarifying is that even though the 'Cream Stout' whey had originated or received an addition of lactose, we do not incorporate any dairy products in our stout, or any of our beers.\"\r\n",

"notes": "Company email (January 2012):\r\n\"I did check with our brewmaster.  He informed me at this time all of our beers are vegan.  We did have a Osyter Stout this fall and that one was not vegan.  Our main beers are all good to go.  We do not use\r\nany animal by-products in the making or filtering of our beers.  We no longer use gelatin in the filtering we now use a seaweed based extract.  Enjoy!\"\r\n\r\nCompany Email:\r\n\r\nYou will be happy to know that we do not use any clarifying agents besides irish moss. Many brewers use a isinglass, or other shellfish derivative, for clarifying purposes after the beer has fermented before bottling or kegging.  I have personally done a lot of research on the subject, not because of the vegan angle, but because i know a few people, including a cousin, that are deathly allergic to shellfish.  It turns out that most of the clarifying derivatives on the market are refined to the point that there are no actual shellfish proteins present, which would cause allergic reaction, only specific minerals which act to \"cling\" to remaining particulate in the beer and drop it from suspension.\r\nThis information comes from the Medical Research Director at Purdue University.  As such, I do not think anyone's vegan status or allergies would necessarily be compromised, but we have decided to just avoid the use altogether.  The complete ingredients for our flagships are as follows...\r\nFarm Girl Saison:  malted barley, hops, pure beet sugar, orange peel, irish moss, belgian yeast, and water. Pale Ale:  malted barley, hops, grapefruit peel, irish moss, american ale yeast, and water.\r\nWhile not \"organic\" (a term still suspect in food and brewing), we think we do a good job of only putting only pure, natural ingredients in our beer, avoiding chemicals and extract flavorings.",

Their very name, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, would have one believe that God's original purpose was to have them ferment beer for us.  We have foisted upon them the Latin moniker as if by appending \"beer\" to their name somehow justifies their unpaid servitude in thousands of fermentation vessels around the world.  In reality, this is just the muticellular-chauvinist elite imposing their world view on the corporeally challenged who are unable to vocalize their ancient physio-chemical intercellular communication to our non-hearing ears.  \"Whats that?  Speak up, unicells!  Tired of the same ol' maltose, maltose, maltose, day in, day out?!  Krebs cycle, CTA, alcohol dehydrogenation, transamination...  Get to work!\"\r\nAnd for what?  To be heaped on spent grain like so much kettle trub?  Fed to ruminants...?\r\nWe don't give a second thought to the suffering of 12x10E6 cells/ml, no, make that, souls/ml.  I think that says more about us than them.  Long before our ethanol infused frat parties or Grecian bacchanalias, or even Egyptian hieroglyphic get-togethers, there were hard working yeasts just trying to scrap together a couple of extra NADHs to feed the buds.  And we come along and exploit their masses for our own decadent desires.\r\nI guess if they are really lucky they could end up in a jar of Vegemite.  Did anyone see Soylent Green?  Brewers sicken me.  I sicken myself, I quit!\r\nI'm moving to Hollywood and making a movie.  Atabar - the story of an enslaved culture of single celled eukaryotes and their struggle to defend their way of life against the encroaching demands of the capitalist beer barons who enslave them.  Think:  Fantastic Voyage meets Dances With Wolves and Beer Fest.  ☺\"\r\n\r\n<b>Editor's note:</b>\r\n\"Eukarotes are organisms with a certain cell type, which includes yeast, plants, and humans.

Our bottle conditioned beers are totally untreated natural products and they are unfiltered.\"\r\n\r\nCompany email:\r\n\"ALL of our cask beers are also POTENTIALLY VEGAN. We are unusual even amongst microbreweries in that we do not fine beers (with isinglass) unless requested by the pub/outlet until the point of dispatch. Most breweries fine when they rack (fill casks). The problem lies not with us by the landlord of the outlet. Fined beer will settle within 24 hours of venting, and in some circumstances a quickly as 4 hours. Un-fined beers can take 72 hours but in any event 48 and very few pubs have sufficient stillage to allow for this. Think: a busy pub with say 8 hand pumps sell normally 32 x 9’s a week, they will typically have 16 stills for one ON and one SETTLING. If they went VEGAN they would need at least 24 and more sensibly 32: This is a logistical nightmare, never mind the cost, and space requirement.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nIn the past year I have been asked ONCE about vegan beer for a beer festival, and beer festivals are even more complex as they usually only have 24 hours set-up time.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nI sympathize with you but I also understand the commercial reality of running pubs, it’s also sad because un-fined beer has more “polish”.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nThe Cheshire Cheese in Wallasey Village often take our beer un-fined as do Stamps Too in Waterloo, and I offer it to all new customers but few take it up and even fewer recognize any demand for vegan cask beer.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nI have recently had a visit form an American chemist who has a vegetable fining alternative, but it is twice the cost, so I don’t see any future here.\"",

So I explained that gelatin and isinglass are used to filter and clarify beer, and he said their beers are unfiltered and they also use no adjuncts, such as lactose.  After our conversation he said, 'I guess our beers are vegan.'\r\n\r\nHowever, since he didn't know what I was talking about, I think a double (or triple) check is in order.\"\r\n\r\nEd note: we send them a Facebook message.

As the isinglass is poured into the beer at packing, it sticks to all the yeast and sinks to the bottom of the keg/cask which is then poured off when the keg/cask goes into service at the bar. All that said, if you know of a suitable replacement for isinglass, we are always looking for ways to improve our process as well as make sure the diet-restricted are not left out. \"",

Due to the introduction of new allergen labeling legislation, Australia's brewers ceased using fish finings late in 2003. Foster's assessed many alternatives for its replacement and selected a collagen based process aid, derived from Australian beef. The Australian Food Standards Code permits the use of this processing aid. Our filtration process removes yeast and finings.\r\n\r\nWe do continually reassess and evaluate our processes and the process aids we utilize. As such, we are presently reviewing an alternative, which is not derived from animals.\"",

"notes": "Company email (January 2014): re: Shock Top Raspberry Wheat\r\n\"Anheuser-Busch beers vary in the type and mix of ingredients, and in certain refinements of the brewing process used to achieve their distinctive and unique characteristics.  But, the majority of our products are brewed without any artificial ingredients, additives, or preservatives.  In addition, none of Anheuser-Busch brewed beers or other products contain any animal ingredients (such as milk, eggs, etc), or process aids such as isinglass or gelatin, except for two small volume brands: Budweiser & Clamato Chelada and Bud Light & Clamato Chelada.  Both the Chelada beverages contain shellfish. \r\n \r\nAlso, at this time, we have not applied for certification from Vegan Action, PETA, or the American Vegetarian Association although we are confident our beers would qualify.\"\r\n\r\nCompany email (February 2011):\r\n\"Anheuser-Busch beers, including O'Doul's, are brewed around the world using water, yeast, barley malt, hops and cereal grains (such as rice, corn, or sorghum). While we are not certified as vegan, none of Anheuser-Busch’s brewed beers or other products contain any animal ingredients (such as milk, eggs, etc), or process aids such as isinglass or gelatin.\r\n\r\nThe exceptions to this are three small volume brands called Michelob Honey Lager, Michelob Honey Wheat, and Michelob Golden Honey Wheat. These beers use real, all-natural honey.\"\r\n\r\nCompany email (May 2009):\r\n\"All Michelob Brewing Co. beers are brewed using only all natural ingredients like water, yeast, barley malt, hops and cereal grains (such as rice, corn, or sorghum).  None of our beers or other products contain any animal ingredients (such as milk, eggs, etc), or process aids such as isinglass or gelatin, except for two small volume brands called Michelob Honey Lager and Michelob Honey Wheat, which both use real honey.  For those reasons, I would absolutely consider all of our beers (other than Honey Lager and Honey Wheat) vegan friendly!\"\"\r\n\r\nCompany email (July 2008):\r\n\"You asked about animal products.  We don't use animal derived products in our beers, nor as lubricant in the process equipment for making beer or our packaging materials.\r\n\r\nFinings, such as Isinglass, Irish Moss or gelatin, are commonly added to fermented beers to aid in the settling of yeast and other suspended particles. We do not use finings in our beers. We eliminate the need for finings by thoroughly settling and removing trub before fermentation. Additionally, the beechwood we add to our lagering tanks attracts and holds back the yeast. After a lengthy 3 weeks of aging, most yeast has well settled onto the beechwood at the bottom of the tank and will stay there when the beer moves forward. These are some of the techniques we use so that our beers can be all-Natural without the use of additives, stabilizers, preservatives or finings.\r\n\r\nAlso, none of our beers contain egg or dairy.  The only one of our beers that is brewed with honey is our Michelob Honey Lager.  We use natural light amber wildflower honey harvested in the Northern Plains and the Great Lakes areas of the United States.\"\r\n",

"notes": "Company email (November 2012):\r\n\"Thanks for the kind words--our Cobblestone is something that we are all very proud of as brewers and the project to get it into Nitrogen-charged cans has been a focus of many of us for the past year so I'm very pleased that you like it!  All Mill Street beers are vegan friendly and we never use isinglass so you are totally good to go with our Cobblestone.  The only exception that we make regularly is our Royal York Stinger Honey Ale that we make exclusively for sale in the bars at the Royal York using the honey that they produce on the roof of the hotel.  The word honey is in the name so we think that is enough of a heads up to vegans out there and it isn't in wide distribution (only in their three bars).\"\r\n\r\nCompany email: Sept 2010\r\n\"None of our beers use animal ingredients or animal-based processing aids.  They are all vegan-friendly.  Our products are not made of exclusively Ontario sourced ingredients, but the bulk of what we use is Canadian sourced and we are moving toward finding more and more of it as close to home as we can.\"\r\n\r\nCompany email: April 2009\r\n\r\nWe do not use animal by-products in the manufacture or processing of our beers. \r\n \r\nThere is one exception which is our Milk Stout available only at our pub that contains milk-derived lactose sugar--this beer is a seasonal specialty that is currently available and won't be around for more than another month or so.  We named it \"Milk Stout\" on purpose so that it sends a very clear message to both vegans and those with lactose intolerance that it contains a milk product. \r\n \r\nWe do not use isinglass or gelatin in our cask beers--we do this intentionally so that they are vegan-friendly.  I don't know of any other breweries who produce vegan-friendly cask conditioned beer other than Mill Street.\r\n\r\nCompany email: April 2009\r\n\"Our Barley Wine is released annually in November.\r\nIt does not contain honey but does have some honeyish flavours from\r\nthe residual malt sugars\"",

The brewery also has some of the same beers on tap at the Milwaukee Ale House and the ones they brew for kegs AT the brewpub use isinglass. But all the stuff they bottle and also keg for distribution at the production brewery don't. Confusing, but there you have it!\"\r\n\r\nFrom a company email:\r\n\"All of my beers are made with water, barley malt, hops, and yeast unless otherwise noted, for example the Ale House Weiss uses a large portion of wheat malt and our Sheepshead Stout contains oats and our Downtown Lites is brewed with honey. Other special beers I've made in the past have used corn, rye, honey, candi sugar, spices, etc. Some people have corn or wheat allergies so I make sure this information is mentioned to the staff here, although most people with these allergies ask first.\r\n\r\nWe do not filter any beer brewed here at the Ale House. I use a traditional method of fining all my beers for clarity. Yes, it involves dried fish swim bladders. It's rehydrated in water and added to the beer in the fermenter. By design it does not remain in the beer, but settles out with the yeast it pulls out of suspension.\"",

We don't filter any of our beer.  We do use fining agents on a few beers, but we do not use isinglass or any other animal products.  Our fining is done using Bio-Fine Clear which is a vegan fining agent.  \r\n\r\nThat being said, we do make beer that isn't vegan.  We make several ales that use honey, chocolate, lactose, etc... as part of the recipe.  These ingredients are always labelled on the tap wall so the servers/staff knows that the recipe uses non-vegan ingredients.  As a company we have always strived to have vegan/vegetarian options and the brewery is no exception.  Basically, unless the beers are specially labelled with non-vegan ingredients on the tap wall, they are vegan.  \r\n\r\nWith a seasonal rotation of over 60+ beers annually, I can't list all the vegan beers here for you, but rest assured that all eight \"house\" beers are vegan.\r\n\r\nThese are:\r\nColorado Kind Ale\r\nXXX Pale Ale\r\nQuinn's Golden Ale\r\nAnnapurna Amber Ale\r\nBlackberry Wheat Ale\r\nFYIPA\r\nJava Porter\r\nIllusion Dweller IPA\r\n\r\nI'm currently at the Vine St. location and all nineteen beers on tap are vegan.\"\r\n",

As far as I know our other producers don't either but I can guarantee this.\r\n \r\nOf course, in saying this, I am assuming that you do not regard yeast or bacteria as 'animal' - both of which are involved in the production of our products - the former very much so. We try to treat our yeast as humanely as possible - creating the most favorable conditions we can for good healthy reproduction during primary fermentation. However, once fermentation is complete, it's a different story. Cold temperatures are used to limit the activity of the yeast and encourage it to settle out in order to clear the products. Once clarity has been achieved, the product is racked off into another vessel and the yeast is discarded. Much of this yeast will still be alive, just in a subdued state. The unwanted yeast is introduced to an active composting system where it would die - probably with a couple of days. I'm not really sure if this is cruel or not - it's a very hard one to judge. In the natural scheme of things, fruit would fall on ripening and fermentation would occur spontaneously - followed by decomposition, so I guess it's not too far different.\"",

We only use entire organic hops flowers instead of the frequently used, already pre-processed hops pellets or hops extracts. In the brewing, fermentation (done with our own, pure-bread-yeast) and storage process, we work entirely without any additives. The beer clarification is done via cold treatment (storage at very low temperatures) and a diatomaceous earth filter prior to bottling.\r\nThe only non-vegan component in our entire beer manufacturing process is the glue that we use for the labelling of our bottles. The labelling glue is made with casein, a substance that originates from pigs. We already investigated alternatives for this glue, but found no viable replacement glue. Water-based glues are not feasible because the bottling takes place in a wet environment and some of our products (e.g. non-alcoholic beverages) must be pasteurized. Another possibility would be solvent-based glues, but the environmental impact of this kind of glue would be too severe.\"\r\n\r\nThis is their German site:  http://www.lammsbraeu.de\r\nAnd this is their American site: http://www.lammsbraeu.com",

In 2003 we used an animal derived processing aid called isinglass to clarify our first batch of Transatlantique kriek.   This processing aid was removed from the beer by filtration prior to packaging so it might be considered vegan since it did not end up in the final product.  Since that time we have discontinued the use of that processing aid.  The brew number of that Transatlantique that was treated with isinglass is 14821 written on the bottom right hand corner of the label.  This beer has passed its best buy date and should no longer be in the market.  Aside from this instance all of our beers are vegan.\"\r\n\r\nEmail 2:\r\nThanks for the email!

Unfortunately, the fish finings work so well that any and all attempts to find a better alternative have been unsuccessful. \r\nAlthough at the end of the brewing process, the amount of isinglass finings in the product is little to none, we suggest that strict vegetarians/vegans do not consume the product. If you would like to try another beer from our portfolio, our Dutch brands such as Heineken and Heineken Light and our Mexican brands, such as Dos Equis, are vegan-friendly!\r\nThanks for your interest in HEINEKEN USA. We hope you try one of our vegan-friendly products soon!\"\r\n\r\nCompany email:\r\n\"Newcastle Brown Ale is not suitable for anyone following a strict vegetarian/vegan diet.\r\nAlthough Scottish & Newcastle UK products are not tested on animals, we treat our beers with isinglass finings (a solution of collagen prepared from certain fish).\r\nThis is the only animal product which Scottish & Newcastle UK ever uses in beer production. Isinglass has been used in beers for centuries as a clarification agent during beer conditioning. In keg and small pack beers, there is very little, if any finings left in the finished product as it settles out with the yeast, and any residues are removed during the filtration process.\r\nIn cask beers, however, finings is added to the beer when it is packaged to assist the settling of the live yeast that is an integral part of cask conditioning. Cask beers, then, will always have some finings in the cask, but if the beer has been treated properly in the pub and isn't cloudy, the sediment containing the majority of finings remains at the bottom of the cask and very little carries through to the finished product.\r\nUnfortunately, fish finings work so well that all attempts by brewers to find a suitable alternative have by and large been unsuccessful. There has been no concern over health aspects, as no consumer ill effects have ever been reported over the many, many years that finings have been used.\r\nAlthough the conclusion drawn is that there is little, if any, finings in the finished product, it is advised that as the product may contain traces of finings we do not say it is suitable for vegetarians/vegans.\r\nThank you for your interest in Heineken USA.\"\r\n\r\nCompany email:\r\n\"Although  Scottish  &  Newcastle  UK products are not tested on animals, we treat our beers (this includes Newcastle Brown in can, bottle and keg) with isinglass finings (a solution of collagen prepared from certain fish).\"",

Its the same gelatin that you would use to make jello shots.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nDerek wrote this article about vegan beer & NOLA: http://tinyurl.com/nolavegan\r\n\r\nComment on Derek's article from NOLA: \r\n\"I am the President of NOLA Brewing Company and I wanted readers to know that this article is the first I have ever heard of gelatin as a fining agent (it is not actually in the beer you drink) as being an issue. I know how important it is for Vegans to maintain a healthy and animal free product to enjoy, and we are already ordering a gelatin substitute to ensure there are no animal products being used (as well as a DE substitute for our filter.)\r\n\r\nI want to clearly communicate that if anyone has suggestions or ways to make our products better for any consumers, we would love to hear the suggestions and we will more than likely take you up on them. We want our products to be the best available, and for all New Orleanians to be proud of NOLA Beer. If this would have been communicated to us prior to the publication of this article, we could have improved our product even sooner. I will personally update our Twitter/Facebook as soon as we have Vegan friendly processes in place. Cheers!\"",

Our malted barley comes from a traditional floor malter (http://www.warminster-malt.co.uk). Our hops are mainly sourced from the USA and as far as I understand the processing of hops is limited to drying and vacuum packing. The only other ingredient is yeast. In our beers we use a dried yeast from Fermentis which does contain a rehydrating agent E491, the origins of which I cannot say with any certainty.  I would suggest a quick look here http://www.food-info.net/uk/e/e491.htm as it would appear that some forms of stearate used in E491 can be derived from animal fat. I will contact Fermentis and seek some clarification from them on this point. I do hope that helps.\"\r\n",

Obviously, the Pig Porter is NOT, and our Strawberry Fields and Vanilla Creme Ale contain honey, so they are not.  Occasionally, we do use honey in other beers, but not as a general rule.  \r\n\r\nWe are not sure about our Pie Whole series, as we do not know the exact ingredients of Grand Traverse Pie Company's pies; we assume they at the very least contain eggs, and perhaps lard in the crust.  \r\n\r\nWe make all our own beers, so there's no issue with using any other processing systems.\"\r\n",

This is almost a no-brainer, but I wanted to let you know that one of the ingredients listed on the label of Rogue Voodoo Doughnut Bacon Maple Ale is applewood smoked bacon. I'm pretty sure this is a new addition to their line but thought you may want to update Rogue's listing on the Barnivore site.\"\r\n\r\nCompany email (July 2011):\r\n\"Rogue products use no animal products with the\r\nexception of one beer--Somer Orange Honey Wheat.

She said that all of their filtered beers are filtered through diatomaceous earth, which she thought was not vegan....  I will accept DE as vegan personally, because it's millions of years old, but I didn't get into it with her.... She also said they have many unfiltered beers, but they make no guarantees, because they may need to run them through a light filter step as well.\r\nShe also said they make no guarantees that they might not choose later to use other animal based filtering methods.\"\r\n\r\nCompany email:\r\n\"Drink up! We are vegan-friendly.\r\nOur Eugene City Brewery makes Honey Orange Wheat. The regular Rogue beers contain no honey.\"\r\n\r\nCompany email:\r\n\"Hi Brian, thank you for your kind thoughts!

She didn't give me details, but said all their beer is not vegan, if you'd like to update.\"\r\n\r\nCompany email: Oct 2010\r\n\"At our brewpub we use gelatin to fine our beers, none of the gelatin remains in the beer but none the less, we use gelatin.  All our bottled beers do not use gelatin and these are for sale at our pub so even a vegan guest can at least drink a beer at our pub that is vegan.\"\r\n\r\nCompany email : feb 2010\r\n\"Actually they (the sour beers) are filtered as we have to filter out any fruit particulates, even the sour beers without fruit I filter as the process just seems to work better.\"\r\nEd note: Being filtered is vegan but fined is not.\r\n\r\nCompany Email: Dec 2010\r\n\"The sour / barrel beers regardless of bottle or keg do not use gelatin.  Also, any beer out for distribution from the brewery, such as beers on tap at Toronado do not have gelatin as they would have been made at the production brewery where we filter everything.  At our pub is just isn’t cost effective or labor effective to run a filter and honestly, the gelatin does a better job as it leaves more flavor behind.\"\r\n\r\nCompany email:\r\nUPDATE: KevinM\r\n\"that the draft offerings of Blind Pig, Damnation and Pliny the Elder that get served in Philly are also vegan.  (Not too many other areas outside of CA get kegs of Russian River)\r\nYay, this is so exciting (Pliny the Elder is considered by most to be the best example of that style - Imperial/Double IPA)\"\r\n\r\nUPDATE: JULY 2009 via KevinM\r\n\" Russian River started out as a small brewpub.  At the brewpub they use gelatin to fine all of the beers for clarification purposes.  This year, they started a production brewery to go along with the brewpub.  They were able to score a nice centrifuge (big machine that spins the beer around to get the yeast out) for this.  At that production facility they make Pliny the Elder (Double IPA), Blind Pig (IPA), and Damnation (Belgian Golden Strong Ale).  They bottle those beers and distribute them all over the country.  However, they also keg those beers (kegged => served on tap) and ship them to a few select markets outside of California.  (Philadelphia being one of them - yay for me!)   There's a good chance most other markets outside of California, Philly, and NYC don't even get draft Russian River stuff.\r\n\r\nSo....\r\n\r\nBlind Pig, Damnation, and Pliny the Elder on draught in bars, or in bottles = good\r\nAnything else (primarily only in bottles - these are barrel aged mostly sour beers) = bad\r\nAnything served in their brewpub in California = bad\r\n\r\nHere's the email I got from Vinnie on Friday:\r\nKevin,\r\nYes, the draft that makes it out to Philly is run through the centrifuge as\r\nwell.\r\nVinnie\"\r\n\r\nUPDATE:  JULY 2009 via Nicole\r\n\"The bottles of Blind Pig IPA Pliny the Elder, and Damnation do not employ gelatin in the production process.  They are ALWAYS made at our production brewery where we make beer in larger quantities and thus use a centrifuge to remove the yeast and not gelatin, we end up with the same results as we do at the pub where we use the gelatin.\" \r\n\r\nDECEMBER 2007\r\n\"Unfortunately, I use gelatin in all of our beers to fine them. We do this to eliminate the filtration process, but, it does put an animal product in the process.\"",

Unfortunately this may make the cask ale unsuitable for vegans, even though the finning should not come through on serving as it will settle to the bottom of the cask.\r\n\r\nHowever our bottled ales are not fined with isinglass but instead we use a synthetic PVPP(Polyvinylpyrrolidone) which is an animal free product and filtered to 0.2um  so should be suitable for vegans to drink.  Currently we have Wandle Ale, Junction Ale, Powerhouse Porter and soon Celebration Ale.\r\n\r\nCurrently all of our ale production is done on site.  Bottling is finished at Thames Distillers using the fining regime described above.\"",

The Jalapeno 777 uses Jalapeno and Serrano peppers in the infusion and the 10 Below is spiced with molasses during the boil.  We do offer some other products from time to time infused with a flavoring agent but I can't think of a time when we've used an animal product to do so...\r\nWe do not use any fining agents in our products, instead we use Perlite as a filter media with the products we want to be clear/bright.\r\n\r\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perlite\r\n\r\nJust a note.  You may want to exercise caution when drinking a cask beer however.  It is traditional to add some isinglass to the keg several hours to a day before serving to ensure the beer is bright and clear.  We don't use isinglass anywhere in our processes but a cask keg in an outside account might be handled this way.  \r\nWe also don't use any honey in our current recipes.  I personally don't care for the flavor it provides and it can be a difficult ingredient to use.  It is also a difficult product to maintain consistency with and very expensive.  That being said there may be a day when we do employ honey as flavor component but I doubt that will happen anytime soon and we will declare it as an ingredient for all to know... \r\nWe have discussed using milk sugar in a beer at some point.  We don't have a tangible recipe now but that may happen downstream in something like a Milkstout.  Like the honey we will declare the ingredient for all to know so people can enjoy it within their chosen lifestyle.\"\r\n",

Most of our regular production brews do not contain any of the listed ingredients either, and are made from Water, Malt, Hops and Yeast. However we brew many specialty beers that occasionally use additional ingredients like honey and lactose sugar. Your best resources is our website, that lists the ingredients for all of our beers: http://www.sierranevada.com/beer. Note: the Coffee Stout available in the Snow Pack now does contain lactose sugar, which is listed online.\"\r\n\r\nCompany email via Rick:\r\nSierra Nevada Brewing Co. uses the highest quality and most natural brewing ingredients while utilizing the very best brewing practices.  This allows us to create ales and lagers with superior flavor, aroma, balance and character.\r\n\r\nAll our bottled beer is brewed, filtered and packaged without the use of isinglass, bone char or any other animal byproduct.  Our beers are brewed with two row malted barley, whole cone hops, yeast and water.\r\n\r\nSierra Nevada Pale Ale is one of our bottle conditioned beers.  Bottle conditioning is unique to our style of beer.  We dose back a small amount of yeast in the bottle.  The yeast ferments the priming sugar and creates the finish carbonation and flavors unique to our beer. Currently, we are using very small amounts  (less than 1/2 of 1% by weight) of potentially four different GMO free dextrose's in our priming's, some of the starch may have been derived from corn but is converted to nearly 100% fermentable sugar and is completely converted to alcohol and CO2.\r\n\r\nWe do not brew with Carmel colors, adjuncts (rice, corn grits, corn syrup).",

I intend to bottle this batch so wanted to include it on your website to let anyone interested in trying it know that it is vegan friendly. The brewery is too small at this stage to have any kind of certification, but as I am the brewer I can assure you that nothing other than the malt, hops, yeast and water are used in the brewing process. Carageenan, PVPP and silica hydrogel may be used in the bottling process as they filter the beer prior to bottling, but they are vegan friendly processing aids and I will be speaking to the bottlers to see if they'd be happy to bottle without any fining. \r\n\r\nThe other beers from the brewery are not available in bottles yet and do use isinglass finings at the moment, but I am still working on getting the appropriate clarity using bentonite. I'll be sure to let you know when those become available. \r\n\r\nAnyway, thanks for reading and I'll send you a follow up email when the Spey Stout bottles are available.\"\r\n",

"notes": "Company email: March 2010\r\n\"Squatters Pub Brewery located at 147 west and 300 south SLC, UT is now serving all vegan friendly beers.\r\n\r\nFor kettle finnings on all beers we use Whirlfloc G, sold by Brewers Supply Group and it is:\r\nEuchema cottonii. Gutweed (Enteromorpha intestinalis) Hijiki or Hiziki (Sargassum fusiforme) Irish moss (Chondrus crispus) ... an seadible seaweed.\r\n\r\nFor filtration we use: Diatomaceous Earth, explained below:\r\nDiatomaceous earth (pronounced /?da?.?t??me???s ??r?/) also known as diatomite or kieselgur, is a naturally occurring, soft, siliceous sedimentary rock that is easily crumbled into a fine white to off-white powder. It has a particle size ranging from less than 1 micron to more than 1 millimeter, but typically 10 to 200 microns.[1]  This powder has an abrasive feel, similar to pumice powder, and is very light, due to its high porosity. The typical chemical composition of oven dried diatomaceous earth is 80 to 90% silica, with 2 to 4% alumina (attributed mostly to clay minerals) and 0.5 to 2% iron oxide.[1]\r\n\r\nDiatomaceous earth consists of fossilized remains of diatoms, a type of hard-shelled algae. It is used as a filtration aid, as a mild abrasive, as a mechanical insecticide, as an absorbent for liquids, as cat litter, as an activator in blood clotting studies, and as a component of dynamite. As it is also heat-resistant, it can be used as a thermal insulator.\r\n\r\nDiatoms[1]  are a major group of eukaryotic algae, and are one of the most common types of phytoplankton.\r\n\r\nPhytoplankton are the autotrophic  component of the plankton community. The name comes from the Greek words ????? (\"phyton\"), or \"plant\", and ???????? (\"planktos\"), meaning \"wanderer\" or \"drifter\".\r\n\r\nAnd finally, but not last, when we just want to clarify a beer without filtration we use a beer clarifying agent called Biofine Clear A3 also sold by Brewers Supply Group manufactured by Kerry. Biofine Clear A3 is a purified collodial solution of silicic acid (SiO2) in water. It has been specially formulated for the rapid sedimentation of yeast and other haze forming particles in beer.\"\r\n\r\nCompany Email: March 2010\r\n\"Here at the Utah Brewers Co-op we use no products that are animal derived in any of our bottled or draft beers. That includes the Full line of Squatters and Wasatch beers.\"\r\n\r\nCompany email: June 2007\r\n\"I can only speak for the beers i produce at my pub regarding their vegan status, because i do not know all the techniques of the other local brewers. My hefewiezen, pilsner, vienna and cask are the only vegan beers we have on tap all the time. I guess if i felt their was a larger demand for a variety of vegan beers i would make more of them. I use finnings to clarify my ales, and as you mentioned, this inhibits them from being vegan. If i do not clarify my beers, the yeast not only makes them cloudy and unpresentable, but it also creates an unpleasant flavor.\r\n\r\nWith that said, you will be happy to know that my assistant is also vegan and has showed great interest in find other ways to clarify our ales with something vegan friendly. I am definitely going to support him in his research efforts. FYI: any filtered beers are vegan. We use DE for filtration and this appears to me to vegan.",

Suede is made with organic avocado honey, so it might not be vegan-friendly to many. Besides that, all of our other beers are vegan-friendly.\"\r\n\r\nCompany email (October 2012):\r\n\"You’ll be delighted to know that all of our beers are vegan-friendly. Anytime we include ingredients beyond hops, barley, water and yeast, we’ll list it on our bottles. Typically we’re adding things like chipotle peppers and vanilla beans, but you may want to inspect them none the less. For clarification we use whirlfloc, a kelp derivative, instead of isinglass. We use perlite in our filtration, which is an amorphous volcanic glass.\r\n\r\nAlso, none of our beers are produced in any other part of world. As it stands, all of our beer is made here in Escondido, CA.\"\r\n\r\nCompany email (August 2011):\r\n\"We are very proud of the fact that our beer is vegan and we are always happy to confirm with like-minded individuals such as yourself. We use vegan kelp-based whirlfloc to clarify the beer and Haborlite, an inert mineral powder, to filter the beer. The rest is just water, barley, yeast and hops.\"\r\n \r\nCompany email:\r\nKeri, thanks for the email and the kind words about our beers. We never get tired of hearing from the people out there that are passionate enough about our beers that they take the time to write and tell us how they feel...especially when they ask good questions. Yes, are beers and the processes we use are totally vegan. In fact, our former Head Brewer of nine years was in fact a vegan!\r\n\r\nDouble Check email:\r\nYou will be pleased to know that our beer is 100% vegan compatible.  So there's no need to defect to a lesser beer.  The fining agent we use for our beer is a protein-binding agent derived from kelp.  No cow hooves, no fish guts, no bad karma points for you.  Now, occasionally, craft brewers such as ourselves may tinker around with small specialty batches and add various goodies like spices, fruit, and from time to time honey (although I don't recall that we've ever used it), but that would be explicitly stated.  Otherwise, our beers are made strictly with water, grain, hops, and yeast (a member of the fungus kingdom, mind you).  So here's to your health and that of our creaturely brethren (and sistren).  Cheers!",

The only animal product which will find its way into any of our beers is piscine isinglass.\r\n\r\nAs far as cask beers go: While some brewers manage to avoid the use of isinglass by relying on a highly flocculent yeast or by sending beer out with rather low levels of residual yeast, we've found that neither of these approaches will give us beer that reliably conditions in cask and suits normal cellar operations.  Basically, we've found it pretty near impossible to sell pale, cask-conditioned beer unfined, so we do normally use isinglass in these products. On the other hand, our darker beers work well without finings, so we don't put any in, making them suitable for everyone, including vegetarians and vegans.\r\n\r\nThe cask beers of ours I'd suggest would be the \"No. 2 Stout\" or the \"Dark Country\".  And possibly other, occasional beers, which we'd identify on our website as being suitable for vegans.\r\n\r\n Regarding bottled beers: We're planning to start marketing a small range of bottle-conditioned beer and we hope that these will all be  unfined. At present our two filtered, carbonated beers are the \"IPA\" and the \"Dry Stout\".  Of these, the \"Dry Stout\" is unfined, hence suitable for vegans.\r\n \r\nAny utensils or containers that may have been in contact with isinglass will, as a matter of course, be cleaned thoroughly after such use, and before being used for anything else.\r\n\r\nWe're always looking to improve our products, and for me this would include moving away from the use of isinglass where we can.\"",

I was a bit dubious about their cask ale so tweeted the Director Andy, as follows: \"Hi Andy Can you tell me if all your cask ale is suitable for vegans ie un-fish-fined?\"]\r\n\"The dark beers are all unfined. At the moment pale ales are fined unless stated on the pumpclip as unfined. Hope that helps\"\r\n\r\nFrom their website:\r\n\"These beers are unfiltered, unpasteurised & unadultered. They are not bottle conditioned either so you get to drink the entire contents of the bottle with no worries about sediment.\r\nWe have carefully carbonated each beer to a level that suits each individual beer. The beer is in it's purest state, we don't even use finings so all our bottled beers are suitable for Vegans too!\"",

If a whisky is un-chill filtered then you will have no problems with our whiskies.\"\r\n\r\nCompany email (March 2013):\r\n\"'Our usual response re suitability for vegetarians, vegans and those with Celiac is as follows:\r\n\r\n\"We are aware of the condition known as Celiac disease where a person cannot tolerate a protein called gluten found in many cereals. Whilst the raw material for The Famous Grouse production will include barley, maize and wheat there is no gluten in the finished product as it is removed at the distillation stage. \r\nIf an allergy is oats specific then you can be assured that this cereal is not used in Scotch Whisky production.  However, our knowledge base is in whisky and not medicine so if in any doubt you should consult your doctor, pharmacist or dietician.\r\nThere are no animal products used in our whiskies so The Famous Grouse is suitable for both vegetarians and vegans. \r\n\r\nRegarding your specific enquiry, our Master Blender advises that fining in the sherry industry is carried out after the sherry is removed from the cask so no animal products come into contact with the casks.\"\r\n\r\nNote from Craig (March 2013):\r\n\"Famous Grouse has Highland Park as a principle ingredient and all Highland Park is from sherry casks, one of the very few distilleries to do so.\r\n\r\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Famous_Grouse\r\nThe single malt whiskies used in The Famous Grouse blend include the Edrington owned Highland Park and The Macallan.\r\n\r\nHighland Park\r\nhttp://www.highlandpark.co.uk/lda/\r\n\r\nSHERRY OAK CASKS\r\nThe type of wood from which the cask is made is the most important element in encouraging specific flavours which give this single malt its own distinctive character. Spanish oak and American oak are both used to make casks for maturing Highland Park and each of these types of oak impart specific flavours to the spirit.\r\n\r\nMost of the Scotch whisky industry uses Bourbon barrels for maturation. At Highland Park Bourbon barrels are not routinely filled. Traditional oak casks are used; butts, puncheons or hogsheads – no barrels – seasoned with dry Oloroso sherry.\r\n\r\nThe oak source (American or Spanish) is of greater importance than the wine type. Spanish oak sherry casks give colour and dried fruit character whereas American oak sherry casks give vanilla and butterscotch flavours. Sherry casks are far more expensive but the view at Highland Park is that they are worth it for the character they give the maturing spirit. Typically, a sherry cask will cost 10 times as much as a Bourbon barrel.\r\n\r\nThe Edrington Group, proprietor of Highland Park, is the leading proponent of wood management within the Scotch whisky industry. It is estimated that up to 80% of the final flavours in bottled whisky can come from the wood. Sherry oak casks contribute to the distinctive richness and multi-dimensional complexity of Highland Park single malt Scotch whisky and are certainly a justifiable expenditure.\"\r\n\r\n\"No sherry will be treated in this way [i.e. fined with animal ingredients] before it is filled into casks. This would be the same for all of our whiskies so we are all clear on the vegetarian front. We know this because we work with our forestry teams, coopers and sherry bodegas from start to finish and through these relationships we can monitor what is happening with every cask.\"\r\n\r\nChris says (July 2011):\r\n\"Just thought that I would let you know that Famous Grouse whisky is Vegan - They have a FAQ on their website which lists it:\r\nhttp://www.thefamousgrouse.com/Content/pdf/faqs.pdf",

Our Five Points Pale is 4.4%, brewed with Citra, Centennial and Amarillo hops. The Hook Island Red is a red rye ale at 6%, brewed with Chinook, Columbus and Simcoe hops. Our Railway Porter is made with East Kent Goldings and is 4.8%. \r\n\r\nWe do use isinglass (fish finings) for our cask versions of our Five Points Pale and Hook Island Red, but all our beer in bottle and on keg is vegan-friendly. Furthermore, the Railway Porter is vegan in all formats, whether cask, keg or bottle.\r\n\r\nThis goes for the many incarnations of these beers as well, which you can see online on Untappd, ie our First Brews and Trial Brews series.\r\n\r\nAt the moment we are still building our website and this information will be on there, but it will be really good to have this information on Barnivore.

"notes": "Company email (July 2012):\r\n\"All Upland beers are vegan friendly, we happily dinosaured the use of isinglass years ago.\"\r\n\r\nCompany email:\r\n\"Just wanted to let everyone know that all of Upland’s beers are now vegan friendly because we started filtering rather than using isinglass!\"\r\n\r\nCompany email:\r\n\"I'm glad to hear you enjoy our beer. I've got good news and bad news in relation to what I call the \"vegan\" question.\r\n\r\nOur Wheat, Weizen, Maibock, Oktoberfest, Winter Warmer, Saison and upcoming Lambic series are all vegan friendly.\r\n\r\nHowever, in order to clarify our Pale, IPA, Porter and Amber it necessitates the use of isinglass because we do not filter our beer. Isinglass is composed of the swim bladders of a specific type of fish, which helps bond to other proteins and settles out during our conditioning phase. No noticeable flavor changes occur with the use of isinglass, and the actual amount that ends up in the bottle and keg is less than one part per billion. That's the best explanation I can give in defense of our use in relation to these four brews affecting a vegan or vegetarian diet. Honestly, ketchup probably contains a similar amount of unintentional insect parts as part of its finished product.\r\n\r\nOther clarifying agents that can be used involve either silica gels or plastic based media that are not digestible and not something we choose to use on this basis. If we ever move to filtration, isinglass we most likely become a thing of the past, but many arguments exist for unfiltered beer being the most flavorful and colorful traditionally crafted in the market.\r\n\r\nIt's a fun subject for me, and I've had several friendly arguments at festivals and bars when this question comes up.\r\n\r\nI'm always happy to relay that the Wheat, our biggest seller, is vegan. The main ingredients are solely malt, hops, yeast and water with the addition of organic chamomile, coriander and orange peel.\"",

We start with these ingredients and expand from there, some beers like our Caramel Porter are these 4 ingredients with Caramel added, in which we make our own with just sugar and water.  For instance our Lemongrass Wit is just the four ingredients including wheat, Indian Coriander, Grains of Paradise, Orange and Lemon Peel.  As far as fining, we use Whirfloc which is a natural product made from an enhanced blend of Irish Moss and purified carrageenan- (family of linear sulfated polysaccharides that are extracted from red seaweeds).\"\r\n",

"notes": "Company Email:\r\n\"Some brewers use animal derived products in beer for the purposes of clarification.  Of interest is the collagen (protein) in such process aids.  The most common comes from certain fish, and is called isinglass.  For the same clarification purpose some brewers also use gelatin, which is less effective but easier to use than isinglass.  When using isinglass or gelatin, it is likely that only very small amounts of those compounds carryover into the finished beer.\r\nWidmer products do not contain isinglass or gelatin.  We receive quite a few questions on this topic and accordingly try to avoid using gelatin in any of our products, even the experimentals, but one exception is a beer that we produce in small volumes, called KGB Russian Stout, that on occasion contains gelatin.  Additionally, some beers that Widmer brews for charity under the Collaborator brand name contain gelatin.  The Collaborator products are not Widmer products, and are only available in the Portland, Oregon market, and in keg only. \r\nIn addition to the fining agents we have two brands that contain lactose, which is isolated and purified from whey. Depending on one's viewpoint a sugar, like lactose, that is isolated and purified from a dairy product, such as whey, may or may not be considered vegetarian or vegan.  If you are sensitive to this concept you should probably avoid Drop Top Amber and definitely avoid Snow Plow Milk Stout (aka Milk Stout).  DTA contains very little lactose, Snow Plow contains slightly less lactose than milk. One other possible exception is our use of milk sugar in Drop Top Amber ale.  I believe the milk sugar, otherwise known as lactose, is isolated from whey.  Whey comes from milk curds. \r\nA few consumers may consider diatoms animals or animal products so be advised that any filtered Widmer product used diatomaceous earth as the filter media.  Some consumers also consider yeast to be an animal, so be advised that any unfiltered Widmer product will contain live yeast cells, particularly our Hefeweizen.\"",

"notes": "Company email (April 2013):\r\n\"As far as my understanding of vegan dietary restrictions go, with the exception of our Thomas Jefferson Tavern Ale, Yards does not use any products, ingredients, or processes that are considered inappropriate for a vegan diet. We do brew an oyster stout-style beer called the Love Stout.  This beer DOES NOT have any oysters, oyster shells, or other animal products in it.  Originally, it was formulated to recreate the historic style, but it now only uses a mineral salt addition to alter the water chemistry.  As such, it should be vegan safe.  The only beer in the Ales of the Revolution series that uses honey is the TJ mentioned before.  Both the General Washington’s Tavern Porter and the Poor Richard’s Tavern Spruce utilize molasses and have no honey in them.\"\r\n\r\nCompany email (August 2012):\r\n\"We have honey in our Thomas Jefferson Ale but no other animal products are used in the processing/filtration of our products.\r\nAlso, we occasionally use oyster shells when we brew our Love Stout, but it is only the shells.\"\r\n\r\nUPDATE: Feb 2010\r\nNote from Eric:\r\n\"I went to Yards brewery the other day and was talking to one of the brewers and I asked about the revolutionary series which I had never tried because the website before showed that they used honey.  Anyways he explained that they used molasses for all but the Thom Jefferson Tavern Ale.  Anyways I was glad to find this out.  I emailed the owner just to make sure, the response is below.\"\r\n\r\nCompany email:\r\n\"We use honey in the Thom Jefferson and we use Molasses in the General Washington and the Spruce.\"\"\r\nCompany Email: Oct 2010\r\n\"We use oyster shells for one of our beers.  We also use Isinglass as a fining agent in the same beer.  It's called Love Stout.  The use of the oyster shells is to extract calcium carbonate which hardens the water and implies a perceived dryness.\"\r\n\r\nUPDATE: JUNE 2009\r\nFrom Kevin: The ales of the revolution series are the ones with honey in them.\r\n\r\nCompany email:\r\nHi Justin ~ Thanks for the email and it's not an odd question...we've gotten it before.  We think it is important for people to know about their food and drinks and how it is made.  Surprisingly enough, we are forbidden - by law- to put any kind of ingredient or nutritional label on our beers.  Breweries aren't governed by the FDA. The macro breweries lobbied the Federal Government very strongly in favor of not putting ingredient/nutritional labels on beer.  Crazy but true.  I guess they don't want people to know about all the chemicals, etc. that they put in their beers.  So, the answer to your question is - no, we do not use any animal products or byproducts in our beers. The filters we use are diametaceous earth so it contains nothing animal related.",
