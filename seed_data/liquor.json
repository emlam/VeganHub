The four-year barrel-aging process gives our whiskey vanilla, caramel, citrus, and honey flavors but there is not actually honey in 2 GINGERS. \r\nI hope this helps! I apologize for the earlier confusion.\"\r\n\r\nCompany email (July 2012):\r\n\"Although 2 GINGERS whiskey is not vegan (there is a hint of honey), it is a gluten-free product. It is made at the Cooley Distillery in Ireland, and there it is aged in barrels sourced from Heaven Hill, Tennessee. Most of those barrels once contained bourbon (which gives our whiskey vanilla and caramel notes) and a small portion of the blend is aged in sherry barrels.\"",

So, thats dairy and animal's fat in Dekuypers.\r\nSo Beam Global gave whoever emailed them, a fake as email that almost all comapies give out.\r\nI'll be happy to email you photos of the Cruzan Cream and Butter Shots if you need any more info.

In addition, please be advised that our GREY GOOSE Vodkas do not contain any animal-by products or ingredients. \"\r\n\r\nUpdate:\r\nCompany Email:\r\n\"The creation of Grey Goose vodka begins with 100% fine French wheat from the highly coveted Beauce region, the Bread Basket of France. This wheat – a most noble and pure grain source – adds the same richness and flavor to Grey Goose vodka that it brings to the finest French breads and pastries.\r\n\r\nSpring water, originating in the Massif Central Mountains, the heart of France, flows into the Cognac Region.\r\nIt is naturally filtered through champagne limestone resulting in exceptionally sweet and pure water.\r\n\r\nThe pure grain spirit undergoes a five step distillation process.  With each step, the true essence and character of the vodka is revealed.\r\n\r\nFERMENTATION\r\n\r\nOnce the wheat has been ground into a fine flour, it is mixed with water and enzymes, which convert the starch content into fermentable sugars (hydrolysis)\r\n\r\nAt this stage, using a yeast bespoke to Grey Goose, the fermentation process begins.  In order to obtain the same fermented wheat, we closely monitor the temperature of the fermentation throughout the whole process.\r\n\r\nThe temperature is maintained by circulating the product in a loop with cold water\r\n\r\nDISTILLATION\r\nProprietary continuous 5-step distillation process\r\n\r\nFocuses on maximizing and concentrating the flavor of the fine French wheat instead of stripping out impurities because we only use the very best natural ingredients\r\n\r\nThe temperature of each of the five columns is continually adjusted to enable reactions to be triggered at precise temperatures\r\n\r\nThe distillation is constantly monitored by measuring the temperature and pressure in the columns and the quality of the high proof spirit\r\n\r\nPURE SPRING WATER\r\nPure spring water is taken straight from the ground and blended with the spirit\r\n\r\nThe water travels over 400km from the Massif Central to Cognac\r\n\r\nNo need for filtration - naturally filtered through the Grande Champagne limestone\r\n\r\nGives it a softness and natural touch of sweetness\r\n\r\nBLENDING\r\nUnder the supervision of the maître de chai, the high proof spirit is blended with the pure spring water until it reaches the perfect strength and optimal taste\r\n\r\nTHE WORLDS BEST\r\nGrey Goose uses the best at every stage of its production process from the quality of its ingredients to its bottling technology.  From the sourcing of the wheat to the moment a bottle of Grey Goose leaves its home in Cognac, a total of 500 quality control checks are carried out\"",

It is used as a filtration aid in the chill filtration process when we make all of our whiskies.\r\nThis is made into a paper that the whiskies will then be passed through.\r\n \r\nAs this material is made from fossilised algae it does affect the vegan whisky consumer.\r\nIf a whisky is un-chill filtered then you will have no problems with our whiskies.\"\r\n\r\nCompany email (March 2013):\r\n\"No sherry will be treated in this way before it is filled into casks.\r\n \r\nThis would be the same for all of our whiskies so we are all clear on the vegetarian front.\r\n \r\nWe know this because we work with our forestry teams, coopers and sherry bodegas from start to finish and through these relationships we can monitor what is happening with every cask.\"\r\n\r\nNote from Craig (March 2013):\r\n\"Famous Grouse has Highland Park as a principle ingredient and all Highland Park is from sherry casks, one of the very few distilleries to do so.\r\n\r\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Famous_Grouse\r\nThe single malt whiskies used in The Famous Grouse blend include the Edrington owned Highland Park and The Macallan.\r\n\r\nHighland Park\r\nhttp://www.highlandpark.co.uk/lda/\r\n\r\nSHERRY OAK CASKS\r\nThe type of wood from which the cask is made is the most important element in encouraging specific flavours which give this single malt its own distinctive character. Spanish oak and American oak are both used to make casks for maturing Highland Park and each of these types of oak impart specific flavours to the spirit.\r\n\r\nMost of the Scotch whisky industry uses Bourbon barrels for maturation. At Highland Park Bourbon barrels are not routinely filled. Traditional oak casks are used; butts, puncheons or hogsheads – no barrels – seasoned with dry Oloroso sherry.\r\n\r\nThe oak source (American or Spanish) is of greater importance than the wine type. Spanish oak sherry casks give colour and dried fruit character whereas American oak sherry casks give vanilla and butterscotch flavours. Sherry casks are far more expensive but the view at Highland Park is that they are worth it for the character they give the maturing spirit. Typically, a sherry cask will cost 10 times as much as a Bourbon barrel.\r\n\r\nThe Edrington Group, proprietor of Highland Park, is the leading proponent of wood management within the Scotch whisky industry. It is estimated that up to 80% of the final flavours in bottled whisky can come from the wood. Sherry oak casks contribute to the distinctive richness and multi-dimensional complexity of Highland Park single malt Scotch whisky and are certainly a justifiable expenditure.\"\r\n\r\n\"No sherry will be treated in this way [i.e. fined with animal ingredients] before it is filled into casks. This would be the same for all of our whiskies so we are all clear on the vegetarian front. We know this because we work with our forestry teams, coopers and sherry bodegas from start to finish and through these relationships we can monitor what is happening with every cask.\"",

I received a personal email from an administrative employee who researched the matter.  She thoroughly explained that isinglass was indeed used for clarification of the liquid, and though it was filtered out completely with the impurities from the clarified whiskey, that yes, technically, that meant that it did not fit my definition of vegan.  She did state that that was the only animal-derived product in the process.\"\r\n\r\nCompany email:\r\n\"Thank you for taking the time to e-mail us. There are no animal products used in the production Jameson Whiskey.\"\r\n\r\nVia Jim:\r\n\"None of the products mentioned in the request for information below are used in any form in the manufacture of Jameson.\"\r\n\r\nIn brief Jameson Irish Whiskey is produced as follows:\r\n\"Whole cereal grains are milled, water is added and with the addition of yeast(a traditional type of distilling yeast is used) fermentation occurs. Fermentation is the process whereby yeast converts the wort, which is a sugary solution extracted from the milled cereal grains, into an alcoholic wash( in effect a type of beer). The wash, which contains about 12% alcohol is then triple distilled to give a newly distilled spirit. After maturation of the spirit in oak cask for the minimum number of years this beverage can then be called Whiskey. The production of Jameson Irish Whiskey meets with the strict requirements of the IRISH WHISKEY ACT, 1980, the purpose of which is to define the production and labeling requirements of Irish whiskey and blended Irish whiskey and all other relevant legislation on the production of Irish Whiskey. None of these regulations allow the use of such products.\"\r\n\r\nCompany email:\r\n\"Thank you for taking the time to e-mail us. Jameson is vegan friendly. None of the items mentioned [dairy, egg, or honey, bone char] are used in the production of Jameson Irish whiskey.\"",

Some of our whisky is finished in sherry/red wine casks; obviously the sherry and wine making process is different from the spirit making process and there are ingredients that may not fit in with a vegan lifestyle which impregnate the wood while the sherry or wine was maturing and this would then be passed onto the spirit at a later date.\r\nSome of our whisky is chill filtered, and some has colour in the form of caramel added, others are non chill filtered, non coloured, cask strength products – in essence there is a mix of products designed to suit most palettes and price ranges – whether or not a product is vegan is something that would need to be determined on an expression to expression basis depending on what type of barrel it had been matured/finished in and whether or not it had any colour added.\r\nAll of the Jura Range is produced on Jura, Barrelled on Jura and Matured on Jura\"",

Our Black Label Tennessee Whiskey is made with natural ingredients that consist of corn, rye and barley malt, as well as the iron-free water that flows from the Distillery's cave spring.  Our whiskey is then filtered through charcoal that we produce at the Distillery and is then matured in new, charred white oak barrels.  We do not use any sort of sealants on our barrels.  \r\nOnce our whiskey leaves it's barrel, it is bottled either as a single barrel in the case of Jack Daniel's Single Barrel Whiskey or after being married with several other batches of whiskey in the case of Jack Daniel's Black Label, Jack Daniel's Green Label, and Gentleman Jack.  Gentleman Jack is charcoal mellowed one additional time as compared to Jack Daniel's Black and Green Labels. \r\nThere are no additives to our whiskies and no animal products are used in the making or maturation of any of our products.  If you'd like a closer look at how we craft our whiskey, we hope you'll visit our website and take our virtual tour (located under the Distillery section.) \r\nThis would apply to all our whiskies and whiskey liqueurs with the exception of Jack Honey which contains actual honey.

It is used as a filtration aid in the chill filtration process when we make all of our whiskies. This is made into a paper that the whiskies will then be passed through.\r\n \r\nAs this material is made from fossilised algae it does affect the vegan whisky consumer. If a whisky is un-chill filtered then you will have no problems with our whiskies.\"\r\n\r\nCompany email (March 2013):\r\n\"'Our usual response re suitability for vegetarians, vegans and those with Celiac is as follows:\r\n\r\n\"We are aware of the condition known as Celiac disease where a person cannot tolerate a protein called gluten found in many cereals. Whilst the raw material for The Famous Grouse production will include barley, maize and wheat there is no gluten in the finished product as it is removed at the distillation stage. \r\nIf an allergy is oats specific then you can be assured that this cereal is not used in Scotch Whisky production.  However, our knowledge base is in whisky and not medicine so if in any doubt you should consult your doctor, pharmacist or dietician.\r\nThere are no animal products used in our whiskies so The Famous Grouse is suitable for both vegetarians and vegans. \r\n\r\nRegarding your specific enquiry, our Master Blender advises that fining in the sherry industry is carried out after the sherry is removed from the cask so no animal products come into contact with the casks.\"\r\n\r\nNote from Craig (March 2013):\r\n\"Famous Grouse has Highland Park as a principle ingredient and all Highland Park is from sherry casks, one of the very few distilleries to do so.\r\n\r\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Famous_Grouse\r\nThe single malt whiskies used in The Famous Grouse blend include the Edrington owned Highland Park and The Macallan.\r\n\r\nHighland Park\r\nhttp://www.highlandpark.co.uk/lda/\r\n\r\nSHERRY OAK CASKS\r\nThe type of wood from which the cask is made is the most important element in encouraging specific flavours which give this single malt its own distinctive character. Spanish oak and American oak are both used to make casks for maturing Highland Park and each of these types of oak impart specific flavours to the spirit.\r\n\r\nMost of the Scotch whisky industry uses Bourbon barrels for maturation. At Highland Park Bourbon barrels are not routinely filled. Traditional oak casks are used; butts, puncheons or hogsheads – no barrels – seasoned with dry Oloroso sherry.\r\n\r\nThe oak source (American or Spanish) is of greater importance than the wine type. Spanish oak sherry casks give colour and dried fruit character whereas American oak sherry casks give vanilla and butterscotch flavours. Sherry casks are far more expensive but the view at Highland Park is that they are worth it for the character they give the maturing spirit. Typically, a sherry cask will cost 10 times as much as a Bourbon barrel.\r\n\r\nThe Edrington Group, proprietor of Highland Park, is the leading proponent of wood management within the Scotch whisky industry. It is estimated that up to 80% of the final flavours in bottled whisky can come from the wood. Sherry oak casks contribute to the distinctive richness and multi-dimensional complexity of Highland Park single malt Scotch whisky and are certainly a justifiable expenditure.\"\r\n\r\n\"No sherry will be treated in this way [i.e. fined with animal ingredients] before it is filled into casks. This would be the same for all of our whiskies so we are all clear on the vegetarian front. We know this because we work with our forestry teams, coopers and sherry bodegas from start to finish and through these relationships we can monitor what is happening with every cask.\"\r\n\r\nChris says (July 2011):\r\n\"Just thought that I would let you know that Famous Grouse whisky is Vegan - They have a FAQ on their website which lists it:\r\nhttp://www.thefamousgrouse.com/Content/pdf/faqs.pdf",
